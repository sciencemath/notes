In statistics we often want ot use sample data to deduce or infer the values of various population parameters, the two most common population parameters
the population mean μ
the population variance σ^2
The population mean is the mean of the entire population, the population variance is the variance of the entire population we should consider these values as fixed unknowns
for example we want to find the mean number of pages per book at barnes and noble we wish to find the population mean μ, but it is impractactical to count teh pages in every book instead we migh approximate μ using the sampling procedure
1. Randomly choose 5 books off the shelf
2. count the number of pages in each book
3. compute the mean of the 5 observations
sample size n = 5
suppose we get the following observations
201, 506, 58, 104, 99
its convenient to denote the individual observations as xi
x1 = 201, x2 = 506, ..., x5 = 99
we can compute the mean x̄ of our sample
x̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(xi)
= 1/5(201 + 506 + 58 + 104 + 99)
= 1/5 * 968
= 193.6
this is called an estimate of the population mean μ, we sometimes write μ (hat) = 193.6 to denote that the value 193.6 is an estimate of μ
its important to realize that our estimate x̄ depends entirely on this particular sample we'd get a different estimate for μ if we took a different sample

The sample mean
it is helpful to think of the observations of a particular sample
x1,x2, ..., xn
as a particular instance of data generated by a sequence of random variables
X1,X2, ..., Xn
Xi is a random variable that denotes the ith observation in a random sample its value changes when we conduct a new sample
xi is the value of the ith observation in a particular sample
Our sequence of random variables X1,X2,...,Xn typically has these properties
they are independent and identically distributed (I.I.D) meaning they are indpendent and have the same probability distribution they have the same distribution as the population
their mean is equal to the population mean
E(Xi) = μ, 1 <= i <= n
their variance is equal to the population variance
Var(Xi) = σ^2, 1 <= i <= n
the sequence of random variables X1,X2,...Xn with these properties as a random sample size n
in general if X1,X2,...,Xn is a random sample of size n then the sample mean is given by
X̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
the sample mean X̄ is an estimator of the population mean μ
X1,X2,...Xn are random variables so is X̄. The probability distribution of X̄ is called the sampling distribution

Estimating a population mean from the sample mean
data is sampled from a population, compute an estimate for the population mean
6, 13, 7, 5, 14, 11, 7
X1,X2,...Xn is a sequence of random variables representing a random sample of size n drawn from a population mean μ the sample mean X̄
X̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
X̄ is the mean value of X1,X2,...,Xn x̄ is the mean of a specific sample x1,x2...,xn
the sample mean X̄ is an estimator of the population mean μ
the value of μ(hat) = x̄ is an estimate of the population mean μ
= 1/7(6 + 13 + 7 + 5 + 14 + 11 + 7)
= 63/7
= 9

example:
compute an estimate for the population mean
3, 8, 10, 5, 7
1/5(3 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 7)
= 33/5 = 6.6

example:
compute an estimate for the population mean
-2, 5, -3, 10
1/4(-2 + 5 - 3 + 10)
10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5

The sample mean as an unbiased estimator
One important feature of X̄ is that its an unbiased estimator of μ the expected value of X̄ = μ
E[X̄] = μ
we can show X̄ is an unbiased estimator using properties of expectation
E[X̄] = E[1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= 1/n * E[Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= 1/n * E[X1 + X2 + ... + Xn]
= 1/n * (E[X1] + E[X2] + ... + E[Xn])
= 1/n * (μ + μ + ... + μ)
= 1/n * nμ
= μ
any estimate of x̄ of the population mean μ found by computing the mean of a sample is called an unbiased estimate of μ

The expected value of the sample mean
A sample X1,X2 of two metallic rings is drawn from a population, the population has rings of two different diameters 16.5mm and 18mm distributed in the ratio 5:1 calculate E[X̄]
to compute the population mean we can consider a population consisting of 5+1 = 6 rings only with the following diameters
16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 18mm
the population mean is
1/6(5*16.5 + 18)
= 1/6(82.5 + 18)
= 100.5/6
= 16.75mm
E[X̄] = μ = 16.75mm

example:
if X1,X2,...,X50 is a sample size n = 50 drawn from a population with mean μ = 30 and variance σ^2 = 9 what is E[X̄]?
E[X̄] = μ
E[X̄] = 30

example:
A sample X1,X2 of two nails is drawn from a population, the population has nails of two different lengths 6cm,12cm distributed in the ratio 3:1 calculate E[X̄]
1/4(3*6 + 12)
= 1/4(18 + 12)
= 1/4(30)
= 7.5
