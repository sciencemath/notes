In statistics we often want ot use sample data to deduce or infer the values of various population parameters, the two most common population parameters
the population mean μ
the population variance σ^2
The population mean is the mean of the entire population, the population variance is the variance of the entire population we should consider these values as fixed unknowns
for example we want to find the mean number of pages per book at barnes and noble we wish to find the population mean μ, but it is impractactical to count teh pages in every book instead we migh approximate μ using the sampling procedure
1. Randomly choose 5 books off the shelf
2. count the number of pages in each book
3. compute the mean of the 5 observations
sample size n = 5
suppose we get the following observations
201, 506, 58, 104, 99
its convenient to denote the individual observations as xi
x1 = 201, x2 = 506, ..., x5 = 99
we can compute the mean x̄ of our sample
x̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(xi)
= 1/5(201 + 506 + 58 + 104 + 99)
= 1/5 * 968
= 193.6
this is called an estimate of the population mean μ, we sometimes write μ (hat) = 193.6 to denote that the value 193.6 is an estimate of μ
its important to realize that our estimate x̄ depends entirely on this particular sample we'd get a different estimate for μ if we took a different sample

The sample mean
it is helpful to think of the observations of a particular sample
x1,x2, ..., xn
as a particular instance of data generated by a sequence of random variables
X1,X2, ..., Xn
Xi is a random variable that denotes the ith observation in a random sample its value changes when we conduct a new sample
xi is the value of the ith observation in a particular sample
Our sequence of random variables X1,X2,...,Xn typically has these properties
they are independent and identically distributed (I.I.D) meaning they are indpendent and have the same probability distribution they have the same distribution as the population
their mean is equal to the population mean
E(Xi) = μ, 1 <= i <= n
their variance is equal to the population variance
Var(Xi) = σ^2, 1 <= i <= n
the sequence of random variables X1,X2,...Xn with these properties as a random sample size n
in general if X1,X2,...,Xn is a random sample of size n then the sample mean is given by
X̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
the sample mean X̄ is an estimator of the population mean μ
X1,X2,...Xn are random variables so is X̄. The probability distribution of X̄ is called the sampling distribution

Estimating a population mean from the sample mean
data is sampled from a population, compute an estimate for the population mean
6, 13, 7, 5, 14, 11, 7
X1,X2,...Xn is a sequence of random variables representing a random sample of size n drawn from a population mean μ the sample mean X̄
X̄ = 1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
X̄ is the mean value of X1,X2,...,Xn x̄ is the mean of a specific sample x1,x2...,xn
the sample mean X̄ is an estimator of the population mean μ
the value of μ(hat) = x̄ is an estimate of the population mean μ
= 1/7(6 + 13 + 7 + 5 + 14 + 11 + 7)
= 63/7
= 9

example:
compute an estimate for the population mean
3, 8, 10, 5, 7
1/5(3 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 7)
= 33/5 = 6.6

example:
compute an estimate for the population mean
-2, 5, -3, 10
1/4(-2 + 5 - 3 + 10)
10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5

The sample mean as an unbiased estimator
One important feature of X̄ is that its an unbiased estimator of μ the expected value of X̄ = μ
E[X̄] = μ
we can show X̄ is an unbiased estimator using properties of expectation
E[X̄] = E[1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= 1/n * E[Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= 1/n * E[X1 + X2 + ... + Xn]
= 1/n * (E[X1] + E[X2] + ... + E[Xn])
= 1/n * (μ + μ + ... + μ)
= 1/n * nμ
= μ
any estimate of x̄ of the population mean μ found by computing the mean of a sample is called an unbiased estimate of μ

The expected value of the sample mean
A sample X1,X2 of two metallic rings is drawn from a population, the population has rings of two different diameters 16.5mm and 18mm distributed in the ratio 5:1 calculate E[X̄]
to compute the population mean we can consider a population consisting of 5+1 = 6 rings only with the following diameters
16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 16.5mm, 18mm
the population mean is
1/6(5*16.5 + 18)
= 1/6(82.5 + 18)
= 100.5/6
= 16.75mm
E[X̄] = μ = 16.75mm

example:
if X1,X2,...,X50 is a sample size n = 50 drawn from a population with mean μ = 30 and variance σ^2 = 9 what is E[X̄]?
E[X̄] = μ
E[X̄] = 30

example:
A sample X1,X2 of two nails is drawn from a population, the population has nails of two different lengths 6cm,12cm distributed in the ratio 3:1 calculate E[X̄]
1/4(3*6 + 12)
= 1/4(18 + 12)
= 1/4(30)
= 7.5

===================================================

The sample mean is an example of a statistic. A statistic is a random variable computed using values from a sample. Statistics are often used to estimate population parameters, although they also have other uses
The following statistic could be used as an estimator for the population variance σ^2
1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2
an estimator for the population maximum
max(X1,X2,...,Xn)
an estimator for the population range
max(X1,X2,...,Xn) - min(X1,X2,...,Xn)
an estimator for the population median
median(X1,X2,...,Xn)
statistics cannot include any unknown population parameters
if the population mean μ in unknown then this is not a statistic
1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi - μ)^2
however if the population parameters μ and σ are both known then this is a statistic
Σ^n_i=1((Xi - μ)/σ)^2
statistics are described using observations from a random sample, they are random variables and have a probability distribution. The probability distribution of a statistic is called the sampling distribution of the statistic.

Calculating statistics
The weights in stones of five randomly selected 24 year olds
12.5, 11.7, 13.2, 12.8, 12.1
calculate the value of the statistic Σ^n_i=1(Xi^2) for this particular sample
Σ^n_i=1(xi^2) = (12.5)^2 + (11.7)^2 + (13.2)^2 + (12.8)^2 + (12.1)^2
= 156.25 + 136.89 + 174.24 + 163.84 + 146.41
= 777.63

example:
25.2, 24.8, 28.9, 27.5, 28.9
calculate the value of the statistic max(X1,X2,...,Xn) - min(X1,X2,...,Xn)
28.9 - 24.8 = 4.1

example:
1.34, 1.24, 1.42, 1.28, 1.39, 1.44
Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
1.34 + 1.24 + 1.42 + 1.28 + 1.39 + 1.44
= 8.11

===================================================

Lets now find the variance of the sampling distribution of X̄ using the properties of variance for sums of independent variables
Var[X̄] = Var[1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= (1/n)^2 * Var[Σ^n_i=1(Xi)]
= 1/(n^2) * Var[X1 + X2 + ... + Xn]
= 1/(n^2) * (Var[X1] + Var[X2] + ... + Var[Xn])
= 1/(n^2) * (σ^2 + σ^2 + ... + σ^2)
= 1/(n^2) * nσ^2
= σ^2/n
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n
we dont yet know the sampling distribution of X̄. What we do know is that whatever the sampling distribution of X̄ is it has mean μ and variance σ^2/n

finding the variance of a sample mean
A sample X1,X2 of two pills is drawn from a population the population has pills of two different active ingredient concentrations 30mg/ml and 15mg/ml distributed in the ratio 1:2 calculate Var[X̄]
E[X̄] = μ, Var[X̄] = σ^2/n
to compute the population mean and variance, we can consider a population consisting of 1 + 2 = 3 pill concentrations
30mg/ml + 15mg/ml + 15mg/ml
μ = 1/3(30 + 2*15)
= 60/3
= 20mg/ml
variance
σ^2 = 1/3*Σ_i(xi^2 - μ^2)
= 1/3(30^2 + 2*15^2) - 20^2
= 1/3(900 + 450) - 400
= 1/3(1350) - 400
= 450 - 400
= 50(mg/ml)^2
sample size n = 2
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n = 50/2 = 25(mg/ml)^2

example:
if X1,X2,...,X100 is a sample size n = 100 mean μ = 30 and variance σ^2 = 9 calculate the value of Var[X̄]
9/100 = 0.09

example:
a sample X1,X2 of two nails is drawn from a population, the population has nails of two different lengths 6cm and 12cm distributed in the ratio 3:1 calculate Var[X̄]
E[X̄] = 1/4(6^2*3 + 12^2) - 7.5^2
= 1/4(108 + 144) - 7.5^2
= 63 - 56.25
= 6.75/2
= 3.375cm^2

The standard error
the standard deviation of the sample mean is called the standard error of the sample mean and is denoted SE[X̄]
SE[X̄] = sqrt(Var[X̄])
if we have a random sample of size n drawn from a population with mean μ and variance σ^2 then the standard error is
SE[X̄] = sqrt(σ^2/n) = σ/sqrt(n)
the population standard deviation σ is often unknown whenever we draw a random sample from a population, we can usually estimate its value by replacing σ with a suitable estimate say s
SE[X̄] = s/sqrt(n)

finding the standard error
if X1,X2,...,X200 is a sample size n = 200 drawn from a population with mean μ = 23 and variance σ^2 = 4 calculate the standard error of X̄
Var[X̄] = 4/200
= 0.02
SE[X̄] = sqrt(0.02) ~= 0.14

example:
X1,X2,...,X100 sample of size n = 100 with mean μ = 30 and variance σ^2 = 9 calculate standard error of X̄
9/100 = sqrt(0.09)
SE[X̄] = 0.3

example:
X1,X2,X3 of three nails is drawn from a population, the population has nails of two different lengths, 5cm and 10cm distributed in the ratio 4:1 calculate the standard error of X̄
E[X̄] = 1/5(4*5 + 10)
= 1/5(30)
= 6
σ^2 = 1/5(4*5^2 + 10^2) - 6^2
= 40 - 36
= 4cm^2
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n = 4/3cm^2
SE[X̄] = sqrt(4/3) ~= 1.15cm

The sample mean and large samples
As the sample size n becomes larger and larger the variance and standard error of X̄ become smaller and smaller it is easy to see that n -> ∞
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n -> 0
SE[X̄] = σ/sqrt(n) -> 0
when the sample size n is large, there is less variance in the sampling distribution of X̄ the larger the sample the more likely it is that X̄ will give good estimates for μ the individual sample elements do not have this property since Var[Xi] = σ^2
the sample mean X̄ becomes a better estimator for the corresponding population mean μ as the sample size n increases

calculating an appropiate sample size
X1,X2,...,Xn of n bananas is drawn from a population the population has bananas of two different weights 1.5lbs and 2lb distributed 2:3 determine the smallest sample size required to give a SE fo less than 0.02lb
E[X̄] = μ
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n
SE[X̄] = sqrt(Var[X̄]) = σ/sqrt(n)
population consisting of 2+3 = 5
1.5lb, 1.5lb, 2lb, 2lb, 2lb
population mean
= 1/5(2*1.5 + 3*2)
= 1/5(3+6)
= 9/5
= 1.8lb
variance
= 1/5(2*1.5^2 + 3*2^2) - 1.8^2
= 1/5(16.5) - 3.24
= 3.3 - 3.24
= 0.06lb^2
SD = σ = sqrt(0.06)
SE[X̄] = sqrt(0.06/n)
we require that the standard error is less than 0.02lb
sqrt(0.06/n) < 0.02
sqrt(0.06)/sqrt(n) < 0.02
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.06)/0.02
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.06/0.02^2)
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.06/0.0004)
sqrt(n) > sqrt(150)
n > 150
smallest sample size is n = 151

example:
X1,X2,...,Xn is a sample size n drawn from a population with mean μ = 12 and variance σ^2 = 16 determine the smallest sample size required so that the SE of the mean is less than 0.1
SD = σ = sqrt(16) = 4
4/sqrt(n) < 0.1
sqrt(n) > 4/0.1
sqrt(n) > 40
n > 40^2
n > 1600
smallest sample size is n = 1601

example:
X1,X2,...,Xn population of bartenders with two different working hours 38 h/week and 40h/week distributed 3:1 determine the smallest sample size required so that the standard error of the mean is less than 0.5 h/week
population mean μ
= 1/4(38*3 + 40)
= 1/4(154)
= 38.5
variance
= 1/4(38^2*3 + 40^2) - 38.5^2
= 1/4(5932) - 38.5^2
= 1483 - 1482.25
= 0.75
sqrt(0.75/n) < 0.5
sqrt(0.75)/sqrt(n) < 0.5
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.75)/0.5
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.75/0.5^2)
sqrt(n) > sqrt(0.75/0.25)
sqrt(n) > sqrt(3)
n > 3
smallest sample size n = 4

===================================================

From the definition of the population variance you might expect
1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2
is an unbiased estimator for σ^2, it can be shown that it is a biased estimator of σ^2
E[1/n*Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2] != σ^2
To compute an unbiased estimate of σ^2 we use the sample variance
S^2 = 1/n-1*Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2
Instead of dividing by n (as with our original biased estimator) we instead divide by n - 1 this is referred to as Bessel's correction it corrects the bias of the original estimator
we should think of S^2 as a random variable whose value varies according to the particular sample under consideration
since S^2 is a random variable it has a sampling distribution (probility distribution)
An alternative formula for a sample variance thats often more convenient in practice:
S^2 = n/n-1[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]

Computing an estimate of the population variance
A random sample of size n = 81 is conducted from a population
Σ^81_i=1(xi - x̄)^2 = 180
each xi is a sample observation, compute an unbiased estimate for the population standard deviation
X1,X2,...Xn is a sequence of random variables representing a random sample of size n drawn from a population with a population mean μ and population variance σ^2 the sample variance S^2
S^2 = 1/n-1 Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2 = n/n-1[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]
X̄ is the sample mean
the sample variance S^2 is an unbiased esitmator of the population variance σ^2
σ^2 = s^2 denotes an unbiased estimate of σ^2 thats computed from the sample x1,x2,...,xn
Σ^81_i=1(xi - x̄)^2 = 180 and n = 81
= 1/n-1 Σ^n_i=1(xi - x̄)^2
= (1/81 - 1) * 180
= (1/80) * 180
= 2.25
an unbiased estimate of the population variance is σ^2 = 2.25 we take the square root to compute an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation
σ = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5

example:
sample size n = 50
Σ^50_i=1(xi - x̄)^2 = 1176
compute an unbiased estimate of the variance
= (1/49) * 1176
unbiased estimate = 24

compute an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation
unbiased 
sample size n = 100
Σ^100_i=1(xi - x̄)^2 = 1584
= 1/99 * 1584
σ^2 = 16
σ = sqrt(16) = 4

Computing an estimate of the population variance using the alternative formula
x1,x2,...,x9 is a random sample size n = 9 from a population x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 4
compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance
= n/n - 1[x̄^2 - (x̄)^2]
= 9/9-1 * 4
= 36/8
= 4.5

example:
x1,x2,...,x11 sample size 11 x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 7
compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance
= 11/10 * 7
= 77/10
= 7.7

example:
x1,x2,...,x6 sample size n = 6
x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 3
compute an unbiased esitmate of the population variance
= 6/5 * 3
= 18/5
= 3.6

Estimating the population variance from sample data
compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance
5, 3, 6, 4, 7
x̄ = 1/5(5 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 7)
= 25/5
= 5
x̄^2 = 1/5(5^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 7^2)
= 135/5
= 27
x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 27 - 5^2
= 2
σ^2 = s^2
= 5/5-1 * 2
= 2.5
unbiased estimate of population variance 2.5

example:
compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance
4, 8, 10, 6, 7
x̄ = 1/5(4 + 8 + 10 + 6 + 7)
= 1/5(35)
= 7
x̄^2 = 1/5(4^2 + 8^2 + 10^2 + 6^2 + 7^2)
= 265/5
= 53
x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 53 - 49
= 4
σ^2 = s^2
= 5/5-1 * 4
= 20/4
= 5

example:
compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance
-10, 20, -30, 40
x̄ = 1/4(-10 + 20 - 30 + 40)
= 1/4(20)
= 5
x̄^2 = 1/4(-10^2 + 20^2 - 30^2 + 40^2)
= 1/4(3000)
= 750
x̄^2 - (x̄)^2 = 750 - 5^2
= 725
σ^2 = s^2
4/3 * 725
= 2900/3
~= 966

Proof of the alternative formula
S^2 = n/n-1[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]
definition
S^2 = 1/n-1 * Σ^n_i=1(X̄i - X̄)^2
expaning paranetheses and distributing
S^2 = 1/n-1 Σ^n_i=1(X̄i^2 - 2XiX̄ + (X̄)^2)
= 1/n-1[Σ^n_i=1(X̄i^2) - Σ^n_i=1(2XiX̄) + Σ^n_i=1(X̄)^2)]
= 1/n-1[Σ^n_i=1(X̄i^2) - 2Σ^n_i=1(XiX̄) + (X̄)^2*Σ^n_i=1(1))]
considering each sum separately
Σ^n_i=1(X̄i^2) = n * X̄^2 from the definition of the mean of X^2
Σ^n_i=1(Xi) = n * X̄ from the definition of the mean of X
Σ^n_i=1(1) = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = n (n times)
S^2 = 1/n-1[Σ^n_i=1(X̄i^2) - 2Σ^n_i=1(XiX̄) + (X̄)^2*Σ^n_i=1(1))]
= 1/n-1[n * X̄^2 - 2X̄*n*X̄ + (X̄)^2*n]
= n/n-1[X̄^2 - 2(X̄)^2 + (X̄)^2]
= n/n-1[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]

Proof that the sample variance is an unbiased estimator
S^2 is an unbiased estimator of σ^2
E[S^2] = σ^2
we'll prove
E[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2] = n-1/n * σ^2
X̄^2 - (X̄)^2 is the variance sample
X̄^2 - (X̄)^2 = 1/n Σ^n_i=1(X̄i - X̄)^2
the variance of the sample is not the same as the sample variance S^2
we start by computing the expected difference between σ^2 and the variance of the sample, simplify
σ^2 - (X̄^2 - (X̄)^2)
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1(Xi - μ)^2 - 1/n Σ^n_i=1(Xi - X̄)^2
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1[(Xi - μ)^2 - (Xi - X̄)^2]
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1[(Xi^2 - 2μXi + μ^2) - (Xi^2 - 2X̄Xi + (X̄)^2)]
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1[μ^2 - (X̄)^2 + 2X̄Xi - 2μXi]
compute the expectation, E[Xi] = X̄ and Var[X̄] = σ^2/n
E[σ^2 - (X̄^2 - (X̄)^2)]
= E[1/n Σ^n_i=1(μ^2 - (X̄)^2 + 2X̄Xi - 2μXi)]
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1(μ^2 - (X̄)^2 + 2X̄E[Xi] - 2μE[Xi])
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1(μ^2 - (X̄)^2 + 2(X̄)^2 - 2μX̄)
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1((X̄)^2 - 2X̄μ + μ^2)
= 1/n Σ^n_i=1(X̄ - μ)^2
= Var[X̄]
= σ^2/n

E[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2] = E[σ^2 - (X̄^2 - (X̄)^2)]
= E[σ^2] - E[σ^2 - X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]
= σ^2 - σ^2/n
= n-1/n * σ^2

E[S^2] = E[n-1/n[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]]
= n/n-1 * E[X̄^2 - (X̄)^2]]
= n/n-1 * n-1/n*σ^2
= σ^2

===================================================

Sample means from normal populations
X1,X2,...Xn be a random sample of size n drawn from a normal population N(μ,σ^2)
X1,X2,...Xn ~ N(μ,σ^2)
sampling distribution of the sample mean
X̄ = 1/n Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
The sum of n independent and identically distributed normal random variables is normally distributed
Y = Σ^n_i=1(Xi)
a normally distributed random variable scaled by a constant factor is normally distributed
X̄ = 1/n * Y
expected value of the sample mean equals population mean
E[X̄] = μ
variance of sample mean
Var[X̄] = σ^2/n
altogether
X̄ ~ N(μ, σ^2/n)
sample mean X̄ is normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ^2/n

Stating the distribution of the sample mean
X1,X2,...,X28 ~ N(8,14^2) is a random sample size of n = 28 from a normal population what is the distribution of the sample mean X̄?
X̄ ~ N(μ, σ^2), 1 <= i <= n
sample mean X̄ has the distribution
X̄ ~ N(μ, σ^2/n)
n = 28, μ = 8, σ = 14
distribution of the sample mean X̄
X̄ ~ N(8, 14^2/28)
~ N(8,7)

example:
X1,X2,...,X50 ~ N(5,10^2) random sample size n = 50 what is the distribution of the sample mean X̄?
~ N(5,10^2/50) ~ N(5,2)

example:
X1,X2,...,X100 ~ N(16,20^2) sample size n = 100 what is the distribution of the sample mean X̄?
~ N(16,20^2/100) ~ N(16,4)

Calculating a probability involving sample mean
X1,X2,...,X100 ~ N(-4,20^2) is a random sample of size 100 from a normal population calculate P(-4.3 < X̄ < -3.9)
sample distribution of the sample mean X̄ is
X̄ ~ N(-4, 20^2/100)
~ N(-4,4)
tansform X into a standard normal random variable by z-scoring
P(-4.3 < X̄ < -3.9)
= P((-4.3 - (-4))/sqrt(4) < Z < (-3.9 - (-4))/sqrt(4))
= P(-0.15 < Z < 0.05)
= Φ(0.05) - Φ(-0.15)
Φ(0.05) = 0.5199
Φ(-0.15) = 0.4404
0.5199 - 0.4404
= 0.0795

example:
X1,X2,...,X50 ~ N(5,10^2) 
sample size of 50 calculate P(4.8 < X̄ < 5.2)
X̄ ~ N(5, 10^2/50) ~ N(5,2)
= P((4.8 - 5)/sqrt(2) < Z < (5.2 - 5)/sqrt(2))
= P(-0.14 < X̄ < 0.14)
Φ(0.14) - Φ(-0.14)
Φ(0.14) = 0.5557
symmetry of normal distribution
Φ(-0.14) = 1 - Φ(0.14)
= 1 - 0.5557
= 0.4443
= 0.5557 - 0.4443
= 0.1114

example:
X1,X2,...,X36 ~ N(0,18^2) is a random sample size of 36
calculate P(|X̄| > 0.8)
~ N(0,18^2/36) ~ N(0,9)
= 1 - P(|X̄| < 0.8)
= 1 - P(-0.8 < X̄ < 0.8)
= 1 - P(-(0.8 - 0)/sqrt(9) < Z < (0.8 - 0)/sqrt(9))
= 1 - P(-0.27 < Z < 0.27)
= 1 - (Φ(0.27) - Φ(-0.27))
= 1 + Φ(0.27) - Φ(-0.27)
Φ(0.27) = 0.6064
Φ(-0.27) = 1 - 0.6064
= 0.3936
= 1 + 0.3936 - 0.6064
= 0.7872

Calculating a probability involving a sample mean in context
blood pressure of adult women in a population that is normally distributed with mean 75mm and SD 10mm. 10 women are selected at random what is the probability that the blod pressure mean for this sample wil be less than 70mm?
X̄ ~ N(75, 10^2/10) ~ N(75,10)
P(X̄ < 70)
= P(Z < (70 - 75)/sqrt(10))
~= P(Z < -1.58)
= Φ(-1.58)
= 0.0571

example:
IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and SD 15, 10 people are selected randomly. What is the probability that the mean score for this sample will be greater than 105?
X̄ ~ N(100, 15^2/10) ~ N(100,22.5)
P(X̄ > 105)
= P(Z > (105 - 100)/sqrt(22.5))
= 1 - Φ(1.05)
= 1 - 0.8531
= 0.1469

example:
weights of a particular breed of duck are normally distributed with a mean of 7kg and SD 1kg, 4 ducks are randomly selected. What is the probability that the mean for this sample will be more than 6.8kg but less than 7kg?
P(6.8 < X̄ < 7)
X̄ ~ N(7, 1^2/4) ~ N(7,0.25)
= P((6.8 - 7)/sqrt(0.25) < Z < (7 - 7)/sqrt(0.25))
= P(-0.4 < Z < 0)
= Φ(0.0) - Φ(-0.4)
= 0.5000 - 0.3446
= 0.1554
