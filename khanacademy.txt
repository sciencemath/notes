cos ratio:
adjacent
----------
hypotenuse

tan ratio:
opposite
----------
adjacent

A pi/6 pi/3 pi/2 traingle is half of an equilateral triangle.
hypotenuse is twice as long as the short leg

A pi/4 pi/4 pi/2 is a right isosceles triangle.
The sides opposite have equal lengths

(pi - theta) reflection of ray over the y axis
(pi + theta) half turn rotation around origin
(2pi - theta) reflection of the ray over the x axis
(2pi + theta) full turn rotation around origin
(pi/2 - theta) x-value and y-value swapped

ray on unit circle intersects (cos(theta), sin(theta))
(pi - theta) = (-cos(theta), sin(theta)) // specific to tan?
(pi + theta) = (-cos(theta), -sin(theta)) // specific to tan?
(2pi + theta) = no change to cos or sin

tan(pi - theta) = sin(theta)/-cos(theta) = -tan(theta)
tan(2pi - theta) = -sin(theta)/cos(theta) = -tan(theta)

======================

Probability:

P(at least 1 success) = 1 - P(all failures)
P(at least 1 failure) = 1 - P(all successes)

Conditional probablility formula:
P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Expected value is the sum of all possible values, each value multiplied by its probability.

~68% from 1 negative standard deviation 1 positive standard d
~34% from mean to 1 stardard d
50% from tail to mean
(68% - 95% - 99.7%) rule

Standard normal calculation:
P(X < K) = P(z < (K - mean) / (standard dev.))
example:
P(X < 1200) = P(z < 1200 - 1497 / 322) = P(z < -0.92) = 0.1788 (from table)

Binomial probability
P(# of successes)
= (#arrangements) * (prob success)^(#success)*(prob fail)^(#fail)
= nCk * p^k * (1-p)^n-k

Normal distrubtion sampling:
np >= 10 and n(1 - p) >= 10

Type 1 error: "false alarm" false positive

Type 2 Error: "missed detection" Accept H0 when it is not the case, false negative.

Calculating z:
p-hat - p0 / sqrt(p0(1 - p0) / n)

example:
included 22 residents who were unemployed (sample 200)
H0: p = 0.08
Ha: p != 0.08
significant level: 0.05

22/200 = 0.11

z = (0.11 - 0.08) / sqrt(0.08 * 0.92 / 200)

P Value:
P(z >= z-value)

P-value < sig. lvl then reject null hyp, would suggest the alternative
Otherwise fail to reject the null H0 P-value >= sig. lvl

Z statistic for proportions
T statistic for means = (samplex - assumed) / (Sx / sqrt(n))

cos2 theta 
= cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta 
= 1 - 2sin^2 theta 
= 2cos^2 theta - 1

Quotient Rule:
f(x) = u(x)/v(x)
= f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x) / v(x)^2
example: f(x) = x^2/cosx

Derivatives of trig:

Inverse Sin:
y = sin^-1(x)
= sin(y) = x
dy/dx(siny) = dy/dx(x) = cos y = 1
= 1/cosy = 1/sqrt(1 - (siny)^2)
= 1/sqrt(1 - x^2) <- in terms of x

cos^2y = 1 - sin^2y
= cosy = sqrt(1 - sin^2y)

Inverse Cosine:
y = cos^-1x
= x = cosy
= 1 = -siny
= -(1/siny)
= -(1/sqrt(1 - (cosy)^2))
= -(1/sqrt(1 - x^2))

Tan:

Inverse Tan:
y = tan^-1x
= tany = x
= 1/cos^2y = 1
= cos^2y
= (cos^2y) / (cos^2y + sin^2y)
multiply numerator and denominator by 1/cos^2y
= 1 / 1 + (siny/cosy)^2
= 1 / 1 + (tany)^2
= 1 / 1 + x^2

Diffeerntitating using multiple rules:

Product & Chain Rule:
d/dx[u(x) * v(w(x))]
Product:
u'(x) * v(w(x)) + u(x) * d/dx[v(w(x))]
Chain:
u'(x) * v(w(x)) + u(x) * v'(w(x)) * w'(x)
Example:
xcos^3(x)
u(x) = x, v(x) = x^3, w(x) = cos(x)
u'(x) = 1, v'(x) = 3x^2, w'(x) = -sin(x)
= 1 * cos^3(x) + x * 3cos^2(x) * (-sin(x))
= cos^3(x) - 3xcos^2(x)sin(x)
= cos^2(x)(cos(x) - 3xsin(x))

Quotient & Chain Rule:
d/dx[u(v(x)) / w(x)]
Quotient:
d/dx[u(v(x))] * w(x) - u(v(x)) * w'(x) / [w(x)]^2
Chain:
u'(v(x))v'(x)w(x) - u(v(x)) * w'(x) / [w(x)]^2
Example:
sqrt(2x) / ln(x)
u(x) = sqrt(x), v(x) = 2x, w(x) = ln(x)
u'(x) = 1 / 2sqrt(x), v'(x) = 2, w'(x) = 1/x
= 1 / 2sqrt(2x)(2)(ln(x)) - sqrt(2x)(1/x) / (ln(x))^2
= (ln(x) / sqrt(2) - sqrt(2x) / x) / ln(x)^2
= (1 / ln(x)^2)(ln(x) / sqrt(2x) - sqrt(2x) / x)

Chain Rule Twice:
d/dx[u(v(w(x)))]
Chain:
u'(v(w(x))) * d/dx[v(w(x))]
Chain:
u'(v(w(x))) * v'(w(x)) * w'(x)
Example:
sqrt(3cos^3(x))
u(x) = sqrt(x), v(x) = 3x^3, w(x) = cos(x)
u'(x) = 1 / 2sqrt(x), v'(x) = 9x^2, w'(x) = -sin(x)
= 1 / 2sqrt(3(cos(x)))^3 * 9(cos(x))^2 * -sin(x)
= - (9cos^2(x)sin(x)) / 2sqrt(3cos^3(x))

Product Rule:
d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)

Product Rule Twice:
d/dx[u(x) * v(x) * w(x)]
= u'(x) * (v(x) * w(x)) + u(x) * d/dx[v(x) * w(x)]
= u'(x) * (v(x) * w(x)) + u(x) * (v'(x)*w(x) + v(x)*w'(x))
= u'(x)*v(x)*w(x) + u(x)*v'(x)*w(x) + u(x)*v(x)*w'(x)
Example:
6x^3sqrt(x)csc(x)
u(x) = 6x^3, v(x) = sqrt(x), w(x) = csc(x)
u'(x) = 18x^2, v'(x) = 1/2sqrt(x), w'(x) = -csc(x)cot(x)
18x^2*sqrt(x)*csc(x) + 6x^3*1/2sqrt(x)*csc(x) + 6x^3*sqrt(x)*-csc(x)cot(x)
= 21x^5/2 csc(x) - 6x^7/2 csc(x)cot(x)
= 3x^5/2(7 - 2xcot(x))csc(x)

d/dx[3^x] = ln(3)3^x and d/dx[ln(3)3^x] = (ln(3))^23^x
d/dx[log(x)] = 1/ln(10) * x
d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/ln(e) * x ??? derivative of d/dx(ln x) = 1/x
d/dx[1/x or x^-1] = -1/x^2
d/dx[1 - x] = -1

d/dn[1.6 * ln(0.9n)] = 1/0.9n * 0.9n = 1.6 * 0.9 / 0.9n = 1.6/n

d/dx[^^3sqrt(x)] = 1/3x^-2/3 = 2/3^^3sqrt(x^2)


ln(x) = -1/2
x = e^-1/2 = 1/sqrt(e)

d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x
ln(1/e) = -1

Volume of a cube:

V = x^2h

Example:
volume is 4 cubic feet:
x^2h = 4
find h in terms of x:
h = 4/x^2

Surface area sum of areas (base, four walls):
S = x^2 + 4xh
he know h = 4/x^2
S(x) = x^2 + 4x*(4/x^2)
= x^2 + 16/x

find derivative set to 0 to get min
S'(x) = 2x - 16/x^2
2x - 16/x^2 = 0
2x^3 - 16 = 0 (times both sides  by x^2)
x^3 - 8 = 0 (divide 2)
x = 2 (add 8 cubed root)

Confirm min:
S''(x) = 2 + 32/x^3
S''(2) = 2 + 32/(2)^3 = 6

Since S'(2) = 0 and S''(2) > 0, S(2) is min
S(2) = 2^2 + 16/2
= 4 + 8 = 12square feet

================================

x-coord point closest to the origin:

Example:

Use the distance formula:

= sqrt(x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2)
= sqrt(x^2 + x^4 - 2x^2 + 1)
= sqrt(x^4 - x^2 + 1)

instead of using chain rule, we can use:
S(x) = (L(x))^2 and minimize S(x) their min will equal same x-value
S(x) = x^4 - x^2 + 1
S'(x) = 4x^3 - 2x

find critical points by derivative to 0:
4x^3 - 2x = 0
2x(2x^2 - 1) = 0
critical: 0, +/-sqrt(2)/2

find the minimum by plugging the crit back into equation:
1) -sqrt(2)/2 = (-sqrt(2)/2)^4 - (-sqrt(2)/2)^2 + 1
= 4/16 - 2/4 + 1
= 3/4
2) 0 = 0^4 - 0^2 + 1
= 1
3) sqrt(2)/2 = (sqrt(2)/2)^4 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + 1
= 4/16 - 2/4 + 1
= 3/4

Surface area sum of areas (base, four walls):

= x^2 + 250/x

find derivative set to 0 to get min

2x - 250/x^2 = 0
2x^3 - 250 = 0 (times both sides  by x^2)

Lagrange bound for error:

|R_n(x)| <= |M / (n + 1)! (x - c)^n+1|
where M is the maximum value of f^(n+1)(z) for any z between x and c

example:
Estimating ln(1.4) about x = 1 what is last degree that assures an error smaller than 0.001?
The nth derivative of ln(x) is (-1)^(n-1) * (n-1)!/x^n for n >= 1

(n + 1)th derivative of ln(x) is (-1)^n n!/x^(n+1)
^ since its n+1 repace the n's

|R_n(1.4)| <= |((-1)^n * (n!)/(z^n+1)/(n+1)!) * (1.4 - 1)^(n+1)|
= (n! * 0.4^(n+1))/(n+1)!z^(n+1)
= 0.4^(n+1)/(n+1)z^(n+1)
where 1 <= z <= 1.4 on this interval

0.4^(n+1)/(n+1)z^(n+1) <= 0.4^(n+1)/(n+1) < 0.001
trail and error: n >= 5

example:
e^1.45 with about x = 2 what is the least degree assures an error smaller than 0.001?

The (n+1)th derivate of e^x is e^x on the interval between x = 1.45 and x = 2 the greatest value of the derivative is e^2 = 7.4

|R_n(1.45)| <= |7.4/(n+1)! * (1.45 - 2)^(n+1)|
= 7.4/(n+1)! * 0.55^n+1 < 0.001 we get that n >= 5

example:
cos(0.95) least degree error smaller than 0.001
(n+1)th derivative of cos(x) bounded by 1.

|R_n(0.95)| <= 1/(n+1)! * 0.95^(n+1)
= 0.95^n+1/(n+1)! < 0.001 we find n >= 6

example:
least degree of e^-0.95 smaller than 0.001

The (n+1)th derivative of e^x is e^x. on the interval between x = -0.95 and x = 0. the greatest value is e^0 = 1.

|R_n(-0.95)| <= |1/(n+1)! * (-0.95)^n+1|
n >= 6

===============

Ratio test example:

x^n/n*5^n
= ((x^n+1/(n+1)5^n+1)/x^n/n*5^n)
= (x^n+1/(n+1)5^n+1) * n*5^n/x^n
= xn/5n+5
= x/(5 + 5/n) <- 5/n approaches 0 so:
= x/5


Alternating hormonic series converges:
(-1)^n/n

Harmonic series diverges:

Marclaurin Series, centered at 0:
f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0) * x^2/2 + f'''(0) * x^3/3! + f''''(0) * x^4/4!

Taylor Series, lets you pick a value

derivatives of cos/sin is cyclitic, marcalion series
f(x) = cosx -> f(0) = 1
f'(x) = -sinx -> f'(0) = 0
f''(x) = -cosx -> f''(0) = -1
f'''(x) = sinx -> f'''(0) = 0
f''''(x) = cosx -> f''''(0) = 1

cosx polynomial representation:
p(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + x^8/8! - x^10/10!
if the above goes to inifiniti we will get cosx
apartently this is how computers calculate trig methods?

sinx polynomial representation:
p(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + x^9/9!

e^x = e^x derivative
e^x polynomial representation:
1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + x^5/5! ...
another example:
-e^2/3x = -1 - 2/3(x) - (4/9*x^2)/2!

all 3 have similarities:
e^ix = 1 + ix + (ix)^2/2! + (ix)^3/3! + (ix)^4/4!
= 1 + ix - (ix)^2/2! - i * x^3/3! + (ix)^4/4!
= (1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6!) + i(x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7!)
= cosx + isinx <- Eulers Formula

e^(ipi) = -1 <- Eulers indentity
e^(ipi) + 1 = 0

===============

Antiderivative:
1/1-x = -ln(1-x)

The derivative is the slope of a function, and the integral is the area under it

===============

z-score:
How many standard deviations below/above drinks

difference between data point (x) and mean (xbar)
divided by standard deviation (o)

z = x-m/o

a z-score can be a fraction: 0.75 = 3/4

Root mean square deviation (RMSD):
sqrt(sum(residuals)^2/n-2)

all distributions of a geometric random variable is right skewed

Geometric mean and SD:
m = 1/p
o = sqrt(1-p)/p

example:
rolling a 1 in the first roll, second, and third:
P(x=1) = 1/6
P(x=2) = (1/6)(5/6)
P(x=3) = (1/6)(5/6)(5/6)

m = 1 / 1/6
= 6

o = sqrt(1 - 1/6) / 1/6
= sqrt(5/6) / 1/6
= 6sqrt(5/6)
= 5.5

variance standard deviation:
o^2 = o1^2/n + o2^2/n

standard deviation
variance:
o^2 = p(1 - p) / n
o = sqrt(o^2)

Normal distribution if each sample success and failure is > 10

Calculate difference of standard deviation from 2 sources:
sqrt((pa(1 - pa) / na) + (pb(1 - pb) / nb))

Calculate z:
+/- depending on left or right from the mean (p1 - p2) / o (SD)
then lookup on z table

Confidence level: z*
Confidence interval: phat +/ z* SD sqrt(p(1-p)/n)
Confidence interval with difference proportions:
(phat1 - phat2) +/- z*sqrt(phat1(1-phat1) / n1 + phat2(1-phat2) / n2)

if we don't have SD sqrt(phat(1-phat)/n)

30n amount when dealing with sample means
10n amount when dealing with propotions success/failure
Independence < 10%

Two ways to write hypothesis:
H_o: P1 = P2
H_o: P1 - P2 = 0

p-value = P(z >= (p1-p2)/(sqrt(p1(1-p1)/n1 + p2(1-p2)/n2))) reject null hypothesis if p-value is lower than significant level
p > sig. fail to reject
p < sig. reject null
normalcdf(lower, upper, 0, 1)
> test above the normal distribution curve
< test below the normal distribution curve
!= two-sided test above/below the normal distribution curve (multiply result by two for both tails)

We can use a confidence interval instead of a P-value for two-sided tests as long as the confidence level and significance level add up to 100%

interval exlcudes 0 reject null, accecpt Ha
interval contains 0 fail to reject H0 cannot accept Ha
example: interval (0.004,0.176) since entire interval does not contain 0 it has a low p-value

When testing the hypothesis find the total instead of each prob.
(dont combine sample size for dividing by n, combine them to find find the numerator for standard error to test null hypothesis)

A t value is better than z value at estimating standard deviations of the sampling distributions of the difference between sample means:
s1 and s2 sampling standard deviations

(x1 - x2) +/- t* sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)

t table comes with coming up with degrees of freedom (df) its usually calculated by either if the sampling of n1-1 is lower or n2-1 is lower

paired t test - compares sample population within the same population
two-sample t test - compares two separate populations (i.e. men vs women)
z-test for proportion - percentages, comparing with hyp.
two-sample z test - categorical proportions yes/no heads/tails
two-sample z interval - comparing categorical proportions
chi^2 test for homogeneity - separate samples before/after a change

if interval contains 0 p-value is high
if interval does not contain 0 p-value is low

=============================

Gadient is the direction of steepest ascent

The gradient encodes the direction to travel to increase the value of f the fastest

A gradient of f at p is not zero because p is on the slope of a hill.
Is a gradient of f at p on a parabla 0? so no incline?

=============================

Direction Derivatives:

When a directional derivative has a direction that equals (1,0,0), (0,1,0) or (0,0,1) it becomes a regular partial derivative

multiplying a derivative by a directional vector by a small amount

lim h->0 (f(a-> + hv->) - f(a->) / h)

example:
f(x,y,z) = x^2ln(z)
let a-> = (-1,0,e) and v-> = (1,0,0)

(f(-1 + h, 0, e) - f(-1,0,e) / h)
= d/dx(-1,0,e)
= 2xln(z)
= -2

example:
f(x,y,z) = x + y + z
let a-> = (1,2,1) and v-> (-sqrt(2)/2, 0 sqrt(2)/2)

f((1,2,1) + h(-sqrt(2)/2, 0 sqrt(2)/2)) - f(1,2,1) / h

add vectors
f(1 - sqrt(2)/2 h, 2, 1 + sqrt(2)/2 h) - f(1,2,1) / h

evaluate f
1 - sqrt(2)/2 h + 2 + 1 + sqrt(2)/2 h - (1 + 2 + 1) / h

cancel out all terms without an h
(-sqrt(2)/2 h + sqrt(2)/2 h) / h
= 0

example:
f(x,y) = x^2y
a-> = (3,-1) and v-> = (1, -3)

f((3, -1) + h(1, -3)) - f(3, 1) / h

add vectors
f(3 + h, -1 - 3h) - f(3, -1) / h

evaluate f
(3 + h)^2(-1 - 3h) - 9(-1) / h
= (9 + 6h + h^2)(-1 - 3h) + 9 / h
= -9 - 6h - h^2 - 27h - 18h^2 - 3h^3 + 9 / h
= -33h - 19h^2 - 3h^3 / h

cancel h calc the limit
= -33 - 19h - 3h^2
= -33

example:
f(x,y) = sin(xy)
a-> = (4,0) and v-> = (0,1)
find the direction derivative of f(x,y) at a-> in dir v->

if directional derivative is (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1) it becomes a partial derivative

because v = (0,1) the directional derivative we want to find is also df/dy evaluated at (4,0)

df/dy = xcos(xy)
df/dy(4,0) = 4
=4

example:
f(x,y,z) = sin(x) + y - z^2
a-> = (-1,1,-1) and v-> = (0,0,1)

df/dz: -2z
df/dz: (-1,1,-1) = 2

example:
f(x,y,z) = yz^2
a-> = (3,1,-1) and v-> = (-1,2,0)

f((3,1,-1) + h(-1,2,0) - f(3,1,-1)) / h

add vectors:
f((3 - h, 1 + 2h, -1) - f(3,1,-1)) / h

evaluate f
(1 + 2h)(-1)^2 - (1)(-1)^2 / h

cancel out all terms without an h
1 + 2h - 1 / h
= 2h/h
= lim2 = 2

example:
f(x,y) = x(1 - y)
a-> = (2,0) and v-> = (0,-1)

because v = (0,-1) we want to find -df/dy at (2,0)
-df/dy: x
-df/dy: (2,0) = 2

= 2

example:
f(x,y,z) = sin(y) + xz
a-> = (3,pi,-5) and v-> = (-2,0,3)

f((3,pi,-5) + h(-2,0,3) - f(3,pi,-5)) / h

add vectors:
f(3 - 2h, pi, -5 + 3h) - f(3,pi,-5) / h

evaluate f
f(sin(pi) + (3-2h)(-5 + 3h)) - (sin(pi) + 3(-5)) / h

f((-15 + 9h + 10h - 6h^2)) + 15 / h
f((19h - 6h^2)) / h

cancel h, calc limit
= lim 19 - 6h
= 19

example:
f(x,y) = y(x + 1)
a-> = (-1,-4) and v-> = (2,3)

f((-1,-4) + h(2,3) - f(-1,-4)) / h

add vectors
f(-1 + 2h, -4 + 3h) - f(-1,-4) / h

evalutate f
(-4 + 3h)(-1 + 2h + 1) - (-4)(-1 + 1) / h

combine/cancel, calc lim
-8h + 6h^2 / h
= lim -8 + 6h
= -8

example:
f(x,y) = 2y^2x
a-> = (3,-1) and v-> = (-2,-2)

find the directional dirivative of f(x,y) at a-> in direction v->
= (Nabla f(a->)) ⋅ v->

lets find gradient of f:
Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy) = (2y^2, 4xy)
from a-> ((2)(1), (12)(-1))

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) ⋅ v-> = (2, -12) ⋅ (-2, -2)
= (2 * -2) + (-12 * -2) = (-4) + (24)
= 20

example:
f(x,y,z) = x^2 - 6y + 2z
a-> = (1,-1,1) and v-> = (-1,2,2)

f((1,-1,1) + h(-1,2,2) - f(1,-1,1)) / h

add vectors
f(1 - h, -1 + 2h, 1 + 2h) - f(1,-1,1) / h

evaluate f
(1 - h)^2 - 6(-1 + 2h) + 2(1 + 2h) - (1^2 - 6(-1) + 2) / h

cancel h, calc lim
1 - 2h + h^2 + 6 - 12h + 2 + 4h - 1 - 6 - 2 / h
= h^2 - 10h / h
= lim h - 10
= -10

example:
f(x,y) = tan(y^2) - 3xy
a-> = (-1,-1) and v-> = (1, 0)

df/dx: -3y
df/dx: (-1, 1) = -3

example:
f(x,y,z) = sin(xz)
a-> = (5,3,pi) and v-> = (0,0,1)

since v = (0,0,1) we can take the regular derivative of z

df/dz: xcos(xz)
df/dz: (5,3,pi) = 5cos(5pi)
= -5

example: 
f(x,y) = e^y + xy
a-> = (1,2) and v-> = (-3,2)

find the directional dirivative of f(x,y) at a-> in direction v->

= (Nabla f(a->)) ⋅ v->

lets find gradient of f:
Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy) = (y, e^y + x)
from a-> (2, e^2 + 1)

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) (2, e^2 + 1) ⋅ (-3,2)
= (2 * -3) + (e^2 + 1 * 2) = -6 + 2(e^2 + 1)
= -6 + 2e^2 + 2
= 2e^2 - 4

example:
f(x,y,z) = sqrt(xyz)
a-> = (-1,-1,4) and v-> = (sqrt(2)/2, 1/2, 1/2)

lets find gradient of f:
Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz)
= (1/2yz(xyz)^-1/2, 1/2xz(xyz)^-1/2, 1/2xy(xyz)^-1/2)

from a-> (-1,-1,4)
= (1/2(-4)(4)^(-1/2), 1/2(-4)(4)^(-1/2), 1/2(1)(4)^(-1/2))
= (-1,-1,1/4)

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) = (-1,-1,1/4) ⋅ (sqrt(2)/2, 1/2, 1/2)
= (-1 * sqrt(2)/2) + (-1 * 1/2) + (1/4 * 1/2)

= -sqrt(2)/2 - 1/2 + 1/8
= -sqrt(2)/2 - 3/8

example:
f(x,y,z) = z + x^2 - y^2
a-> = (-1,2,0) and v-> = (1,2,1)

Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz)
= (2x, -2y, 1)

from a-> (-1,2,0)
= (-2, -4, 1)

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) = (-2, -4, 1) ⋅ (1,2,1)
(-2 * 1) + (-4 * 2) + (1 * 1)

= -2 - 8 + 1
= 9

example:
f(x,y) = e^x + 1/y
a-> = (-2,4) and v-> = (0,1)

since (0,1) is directional we take the derivative

df/dy: -1/y^2
df/dy: (-2,4) = -1/16


example:
f(x,y) = 4ye^x
a-> = (1,-1) and v-> = (-1,0)
(4ye^x, 4e^x)

from a-> (1,-1)
= (-4e^1, 4e^1)

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) = (-4e^1, 4e^1) ⋅ (-1,0)
(-4e^1 * -1) + (4e^1 * 0)
= 4e^1

*NOTE we could have just took the negative of the x and plugged values in!

example:
f(x,y,z) = xy/z
a-> = (-3,2,1) and v-> = (1,1,1)

Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz)
= (y/z, x/z, xy/z^2)

plugging in from a-> (-3,2,1)
= (2, -3, 6)

therefore:
(Nabla f(a->)) ⋅ v-> = (2,-3,6) ⋅ (1,1.1)
= 5

example:
f(x,y) = x + 3y + 2
a-> = (0,0) and v-> = (2,3)

Nabla f = (df/dx, df/dy)
= (1, 3)

plugging in from a-> (1, 3) no change

(Nabla f(a->)) = (1, 3) ⋅ (2,3)
(1 * 2) + (3 * 3) = 2 + 9
= 11

=============================

The speed of a parametric curve is the magnitude of its velocity.
Speed: ||f'(x)|| = sqrt(a'(t)^2 + b'(t)^2 + c'(t)^2)

=============================

Multivariable Chain Rule:

f(x,y) = x^2y
x(t) = cos(t)
y(t) = sin(t)

derivative of: (cos(t))^2sin(t) <- f(x, y)

left stays the same right changes then + right stays same then chain rule of the left (derivative of outside then inside):

cos^2cos(t) + sin(t)(2(cos(t)(-sin(t))))
= cos^2(t)cos(t) + 2cos(t)sin(t)(-sin(t))

RULE:
d/dt f(x(t), y(t)) = ∂f/∂x * dx/dt + ∂f/∂y * dy/dt

if we take the example from above:
cos^2(t)cos(t) + 2cos(t)sin(t)(-sin(t)) we can plug in the values from above
d/dt f(x(t), y(t)) = f(cos(t), sin(t)) = f(cos(t)^2, sin(t)):

cos^2(t) = ∂f/∂y
cos(t) = dy/dt
2cos(t)sin(t) = ∂f/∂x
-sin(t) = dx/dt

dh/dt = ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t)
g'(t) a change in t causes the input into f to move (the direction)
∇f(g(t)) how much f will change in response to this update to its input

example:
vector-valued function g(t) and scalar function f(x,y)
h(t) = f(g(t))

g(-1) = (-3, 0)
g'(-1) = (9, -1)
∇f(-3,0) = (2, 5)
evaluate dh/dt at t = -1

h'(-1) = (2, 5) ⋅ (9, -1)
= 13

example:
f(x,y,z) = xz + yz and g(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t)
h(t) = f(g(t))

multivariable chain rule says dh/dt = ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t)

g(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t)
g'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)

derivative from our function
∇f = (z, z, x + y)

plugging in

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(t) = -tsin(t) + tcos(t) + cos(t) + sin(t)

example:
f(x,y,z) = zcos(y) + z^2x and g(t) = (t, -t^2, -t)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(t) = t^2 - 2t^2sin(-t^2) - cos(-t^2) + 2t^2
= 3t^2 + 2t^2sin(t^2) - cos(t^2)

example:
f(x,y,z) = zx^2 + y^3 and g(t) = (t, sin(3t), sin(2t))
h(t) = f(g(t))

g(t) = (t, sin(3t), sin(2t))

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(t) = 2tsin(2t) + 9sin^2(3t)cos(3t) + 2t^2cos(2t)

h(t) = f(g(t))

g(t) = (sin(t), -cos(t))

∇f(g(t)) = (2/sin(t), 1)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(x) = 2/sin(t)cos(t) + sin(t)

example:

∇f(g(t)) = ((6 - 2t)/(1 - 2t)^2, (-4 - 2t)/(1 - 2t)^2)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(t) = (6 - 2t)/(1 - 2t)^2 + (4 + 2t)/(1 - 2t)^2
= 10/(1 - 2t)^2

example:
f(x,y) = e^(x^2 + y^2) and g(t) = (4t, 3t)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(t) = 32te^(25t^2) + 18te^(25t^2)
= 50te^(25t^2)

example:

∇f(-cos(x), sin(y))

∇f(g(pi/3)) = (-2pi/3, 4pi/3) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(pi/3) = (-2, 4) ⋅ (1/2, sqrt(3)/2)

find h'(4)

g(4) = (16, 8)
g'(4) = (2t, 2) = (8, 2)

∇f(2, 3)

∇f(g(4)) = (16, 8) = (2, 3)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(4) = (2,3) ⋅ (8,2) = 16 + 6 = 22

example:
f(x,y,z) = y^2z and g(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)
h(t) = f(g(t))
find h'(2)

g(2) = (2, 4, 8)

∇f(0, 2yz, y^2)

∇f(g(2)) = (2, 4, 8) = (0, 64, 16)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(2) = (0, 64, 16) ⋅ (1, 4, 12)
= 256 + 192
= 448

example:

∇f(y - sqrt(z), x, -x/2sqrt(z))

∇f(g(1)) = (2, -1, 4) = (-3, 2, -1/2)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(1) = (-3, 2, -1/2) ⋅ (0, -1, 8)
= -2 - 4
= -6

example:

∇f(-6x, 4y, 1)

∇f(g(2)) = (4, 2, 2) = (-24, 8, 1)

substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(2) = (2, 1/2, 1) ⋅ (-24, 8, 1)
= -48 + 4 + 1

∇f(4xy, 2x^2)

∇f(g(pi)) = (-1, 0) = (0, 2)
substitute ∇f(g(t)) ⋅ g'(t):
h'(pi) = (0, -1) ⋅ (0, 2)
= -2

=============================

Another way to write multivariable chain rule:
(Vector notation)

Reminder for single variable calc
d/dx f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)

v-> t = [x(t), y(t)]
dv/dt = [dx/dt, dy/dt]

= [∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y] ⋅ [dx/dt, dy/dt]
= ∇f ⋅ v'->(t)

chain rule:
∇f(v->(t)) ⋅ v->'(t)

directional derivative:
∇_(v->(t))f(v->(t))

=============================

Divergence

v->(x,y) = [P(x,y), Q(x,y)]

divv->(x,y) = ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y

=============================

Curl:

2d-curlv->(x,y) = ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y

curlv->(x,y,z)
3dcurl = ∇ x v->
Cross product with the vectors, change, multivariable functions
= determinate([
	[i, j, k],
	[∂/∂x, ∂/∂y/, ∂/∂z],
	[P, Q, R]
])
= i(∂R/∂y - ∂Q/∂y) - j(∂R/∂x - ∂P/∂z) + k(∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y)

curl(F) = ∇ x F
div(F) = ∇ ⋅ F

the diverence of a vector field is a scalar field

∇ = [∂/∂x, ∂/∂y]

The gradient takes a scalar field and gives a vector field:
grad(f) = ∇f

=============================

Laplacian
Similair to a second derivative for scalar valued functions for multivariable functions

(The divergence of the graident of our function)

If the Laplacian is negative at that point, it's a maximum. If it is positive, the point is a minimum.

∆f(x,y)
∆f = ∇⋅∇f

if f is a scalar then the gradient of (∇f) gives you a vector field, and the divergence of the vector field gives you (∇⋅∇f) another scalar valued function:
∇⋅∇f
div(gradf)

Harmonic function:
stability around a point (neighboring points are balanced)

∆f(x,y) = ∇⋅∇f(x,y) === 0

usually starts as linear no curves:
f''(x) = 0
f'(x) = c
f(x) = cx + c

∆f = ∇^2f
= div(∇f)
=div(grad(f))

=============================

Jacobian Matrix
x in first column, y in second, etc.

[
	∂f1/∂x ∂f1/∂y 
	∂f2/∂x ∂f2/∂y 
]

If the Jacobian determinant is equal to 0 it will infinitely contract

If the Jacobian determinant is less than 1 but not 0 it will finitely contract


If the Jacobian determinant is 1 leave is the same


anything else Jacobian determinant expands

Computing a tagent plane

Linear approximation

L(x,y) = a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + z_0

(x_0,y_0,z_0)

example:
(1, -2, f(1, -2))

f(x,y) = 3 - 1/3*x^2 - y^2
= 3 - 1/3*1^2 - (-2)^2
= 3 - 1/3 - 4
= -4/3

L(x,y) = a(x - 1) + b(y - (-2)) - 4/3

a = ∂f/∂x(1,2)
b = ∂f/∂y(1,2)

(f from above)
∂f/∂x = -2/3x = -2/3
∂f/∂y = -2y = -2(-2) = 4

equation for the plane tagent to S at point(a,b,c)
0 = (v_0,v_1,v_2) ⋅ (F_x, F_y, F_z)
= (x - a, y - b, z - c) ⋅ (F_x, F_y, F_z)
= F_x(x - a) + F_y(y - b) + F_z(z - c)

If our surface was defined explicity as f(x,y) = z we could rewrite it as F(x, y, z) = f(x,y) - z = 0
f_x(x - a) + f_y(y - b) - (z - c) = 0
c + f_x(x - a) + f_y(y - b) = z
f(a, b) + f_x(x - a) + f_y(y - b) = z

derivative:
d/dx: ye^(2x) = 2ye^(2x)

Local Linearization:
approximates one function near a point based on information you get from its derivative(s) at that point.

vector (x's are bolded):
f(x_0) + ∇f(x_0)⋅(x - x_0)

f(x_0) = Constant
∇f(x_0)⋅(x - x_0) = Linear term
x_0 = [x_0, y_0]
x = [x, y]

affine functions are linear functions that don't pass through the origin

derivative:
d/dx: sqrt(x) = x^(1/2) = 1/2x^(-1/2) = 1/2sqrt(x)

=============================

Quadradic Approximation

Q(x,y) = f(x_0, y_0) + fx(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + fy(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)
+ a(x - x_0)^2 + b(x - x_0)(y - y_0) + c(y - y_0)^2

want
(second derivative respect to x)
first:
∂^2Q/∂x^2 = ∂/∂x(fx(x_0, y_0) + 2a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0))
second:
= 2a

want
fxx(x_0, y_0)
a = 1/2fxx(x_0, y_0)

(first derivative with respect to x, second derivative with respect to y)
∂^2Q/∂y∂x = ∂/∂y(fx(x_0, y_0) + 2a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0))
= b
want
b = fxy(x_0, y_0)

want
(second derivative respect to y)
first:
∂^2Q/∂y^2 = ∂/∂x(fx(x_0, y_0) + 2a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0))
second:
= 2c

want
fyy(x_0, y_0)
c = 1/2fxx(x_0, y_0)

Q(x,y) = f(x_0, y_0) + f_x(x_0, y_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)
+ 1/2f_xx(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0)^2 + f_xy(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0)(y - y_0)
+ 1/2f_yy(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)^2

example:
f(x,y) = e^(x/2)sin(y)
at point (0, pi/2)

f(x,y) = e^(x/2)sin(y) = 1
f_x(x,y) = 1/2*e^(x/2)sin(y) = 1/2
f_y(x,y) = e^(x/2)cos(y) = 0
f_xx(x,y) = 1/4*e^(x/2)sin(y) = 1/4
f_xy(x,y) = 1/2*e^(x/2)cos(y) = 0
f_yy(x,y) = -e^(x/2)sin(y) = -1

Q(x, y) = 1 + 1/2(x - 0) + 0(y - pi/2) + 1/2*1/4(x - 0)^2
+ 0(x - 0)(y - pi/2) + 1/2(-1)(y - pi/2)^2

= 1 + x/2 + x^2/8 + -1/2(y - pi/2)^2

Hessian Matrix

f(x,y) = e^(x/2)sin(y)

∂f/∂x = 1/2*e^(x/2)sin(y)
∂f/∂y = e^(x/2)cos(y)

H_f = [
	∂^2f/∂x^2 ∂^2f/∂x∂y
	∂^2f/∂y∂x ∂^2f/∂y^2
]

(with an added z):

H_f = [
	∂^2f/∂x^2 ∂^2f/∂x∂y ∂^2f/∂x∂z
	∂^2f/∂y∂x ∂^2f/∂y^2 ∂^2f/∂y∂z
	∂^2f/∂z∂x ∂^2f/∂z∂y ∂^2f/∂z^2
]

= [
	1/4*e^(x/2)sin(y) 1/2*e^(x/2)cos(y)
	1/2*e^(x/2)cos(y) e^(x/2)(-sin(y))
]

The order of mixed partial derivatives often doesn't matter, the Hessian matrix is usually symmetric. We can use this fact to find f_xy which is equal to f_yx.

The bottom left and top right entries of the Hessian are usually the same.

Hessian notation
1/2(x - x_0)^TH_f(x_0)(x - x_0)

Q_f(x) = f(x_0) + ∇f(x_0)⋅(x - x_0) + 1/2(x - x_0)^TH_f(x_0)(x - x_0)

Hessian is related to Jacobian matrix
More formally: Hf(x) = J(∇ f(x))^T
It also relates to the Laplacian as an operator: Δf = ∇^2f = trace(H(f))

review:
In single variable calc if setting derivative to 0 your finding the flat tagent points in graph max/min areas.

If second derivative < 0 (f'') you have a concave down your at a local maximum and vise versa.

Finding if a saddle point exists
(second partial derivative test)
∇f(x_0, y_0) = 0

H > 0 and fxx > 0 local min
H > 0 and fxx < 0 local max
H < 0: Saddle Point
H = 0: ?

if fxx and fyy disagree on max vs min
H = fxxfyy - fxyfyx

H = (2sqrt(3))(2sqrt(3)) - (0)(0) = 12
H is positive means at local min or max

fy = cos(x + y) + cos(x - y)
fxx = -sin(x + y) + sin(x - y) = 1 + 1
fyy = -sin(x + y) + sin(x - y) = 1 + 1
fyx = -sin(x + y) - sin(x - y) = 1 - 1
fxy = -sin(x + y) - sin(x - y) = 1 - 1

H = (2)(2) - (0)(0) = 4

fyy = -sin(y) = -1
fxy = 0
fyx = 0

H = (-1)(-1) - (0)(0) = 1
H > 0 local min/max fxx < 0 = local max

fx = 3(x - 5)^2(y + 2)^2
fy = 2(x - 5)^3(y + 2)
fxx = 6(x - 5)(y + 2)^2 = 0
fyy = 2(x - 5)^3 = 0
fxy = 6(x - 5)^2(y + 2) = 0
fyx = 6(x - 5)^2(y + 2) = 0

H = (0)(0) - (0)(0) = 0
H = 0 inconclusive

example:

=============================

Integration by parts review:
find 4 parts u, du, v dv
u is one part du is another
v is the intergral of dv
du is the derivative of u

example:
S x^2lnx dx

u = lnx
du = 1/x dx
v = x^3/3
dv = x^2 dx

chosed lnx as u because its easier to take the derivative then antiderivative

S udv = uv - S vdu

lnx(x^3/3) - S x^3/3 * 1/x dx
= 1/3*x^3 lnx - 1/3 S x^2 dx
= 1/3*x^3 lnx - 1/3 x^3/3 + C
= 1/3*x^3 lnx - 1/9*x^3 + C

example:
S lnx dx

u = lnx
du = 1/x dx
v = x
dv = 1dx

S udv = uv - S vdu

= (ln x)(x) - S x(1/x)dx
= xlnx - S 1dx
= xlnx -x + C

example (2 times integration by parts):
S x^2sinx dx

u = x^2
du = 2x dx
v = -cosx
dv = sinx dx

S udv = uv - S vdu

= x^2(-cosx) + S (-cosx)(2x) dx
= -x^2cosx + 2 S xcosx dx

S xcosx dx

u = x
du = 1dx
v = sinx
dv = cosx dx

S udv = uv - S vdu

= xsinx - S sinx(dx)
= xsinx - (-cosx) + C

Now lets replace our formula from above with our second part:
= -x^2cosx + 2 S xcosx dx
= -x^2cosx + 2xsinx + 2cosx + C

=============================

Independent path:

c: x = x(t) y = y(t) a <= t <= b
S_a^b f(x(t), y(t))sqrt(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2)

-c: x = x(a+b-t) y = y(a+b-t) a <= t <= b
= -x'(a+b-t) -y'(a+b-t)

u = a+b-t, du/dt = -1 du = -dt dt= -du
t = a, u = a+b-a = b
t = b, u = a+b-b = a

-S_b^a f(x(u), y(u))sqrt(x'(u)^2 + y'(u)^2) * du
flip the intergal switch signs:
= S_a^b f(x(u), y(u))sqrt(x'(u)^2 + y'(u)^2) * du

When dealing with line intergrals with vector fields the direction matters one is negative, when dealing with scalar field it doesn't as shown above.

f-> is path independent (conservative) if ∮f->⋅dr

for closed intervals (∮):
S_c1 f->⋅dr-> + S_-c2 f->⋅dr-> = 0
= ∮_c1+(-c2) f->⋅dr-> = 0

A vector field f is conservative if f(x,y) = ∇g(x,y)

S_c f⋅ds = g(Cend) - g(Cstart)

example:
s(x,y) = 4x^3 - 2y^4
C starts (-2,0), passes thro (0,1) ends at (2,0)

find line integral of the gradient s around the curve C

Cstart = (-2, 0)
Cend = (2, 0)

S_c ∇s⋅ds = s(2,0) - s(-2,0)
= 4(2)^3 - 2(0)^4 - (4(-2)^3 - 2(0)^4)
= 32 + 32
= 64

example:
s(x,y) = e^x + y be the curve(cos(t), sin(t)) traversed from
t = pi/2 to t = 3pi/2

Cstart = (cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)) = (0, 1)
Cend = (cos(3pi/2), sin(3pi/2)) = (0, -1)

S_c ∇s⋅ds = s(0, -1) - s(0, 1)
= e^0 - 1 - (e^0 + 1)
= -2

example:
s(x,y) = y - 4x curve (cos(2t), sin(t))
t = pi to t = 3pi/2

Cstart = (cos(2pi), sin(pi)) = (1, 0)
Cend = (cos(3pi), sin(3pi/2)) = (-1, -1)

S_c ∇s⋅ds = s(-1, -1) - s(1, 0)
= -1 - 4(-1) - (0 - 4(1))
= 7

=============================

Line integral of conservative vector field

S_c (x^2 + y^2) dx + 2xy dy
c: x = cost, y = sint, 0 <= t <= pi

f->(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2)i + (2xy)j
dr-> = dxi + dyj
S_0^pi f->⋅dr-> = F(pi) - F(0)
= F(x(pi),y(pi)) - F(x(0),y(0))

if f-> = ∇F = path independent integral

∂F/∂x = x^2 + y^2
antiderivative
F(x,y) = x^3/3 + xy^2

∂F/∂x = 2xy
antiderivative
F(x,y) = xy^2 + f(x)

F(x,y) = x^3/3 + xy^2
x = cost, y = sint
x(0) = 1
x(pi) = -1
y(0) = 0
y(pi) = 0

(x(pi), y(pi)) (x(0), y(0))
S_c f->⋅dr-> = F(-1, 0) - F(1, 0)
= -1/3 - 1/3 = -2/3

example:
f(x,y) = (y/x, ln(2x))
S F_x
= S y/x dx
= yln(x) + H(y)

S F_y
S ln(2x) dy
= yln(2x) + G(x)

We can set both ways of writing F equal to find G and H
yln(x) + H(y) = yln(2x) + G(x)

Split the logarithm on the right hand side
ln(2x) = ln(x) + ln(2) therefore:

G(x) = C_1
H(y) = yln(2) + C_2
F(x,y) = yln(2x) + C

example:
f(x,y) = (-sin(x)sin(y), cos(x)cos(y))
F_x = -sin(x)sin(y)
F_y = cos(x)cos(y)

S  -sin(x)sin(y) dx
= cos(x)sin(y) + H(y)

S cos(x)cos(y) dy
= cos(x)sin(y) + G(x)

cos(x)sin(y) + H(y) = cos(x)sin(y) + G(x)
G(x) = C_1
H(y) = C_2
F(x,y) = cos(x)sin(y) + C

example:
f(x,y) = (1/2sqrt(x), 1/2sqrt(y))
F_x = 1/2sqrt(x)
F_y = 1/2sqrt(y)

S 1/2sqrt(x) dx
= sqrt(x)

S 1/2sqrt(y) dy
= sqrt(x)

F(x,y) = sqrt(x) + sqrt(y)

example:
f(x,y) = (-sin(x), 4e^4y)
F_x = -sin(x)
F_y = 4e^4y

S -sin(x) dx
= cos(x)

S 4e^4y
= e^4y

F(x,y) = cos(x) + e^4y

example: 
f(x,y) = (e^y, -e^-y + xe^y)
F_x = e^y
F_y = -e^-y + xe^y

S e^y dx
= xe^y

S -e^-y + xe^y
= e^-y + xe^4

F(x,y) = e^-y + xe^y

example:
f(x,y) = (2(x - y), 2(y - x))
F_x = 2(x - y)
F_y = 2(y - x)

S 2(x - y) dx
= x^2 - 2xy

S 2(y - x) dy
= y^2 - 2xy

x^2 - 2xy + H(y) = y^2 - 2xy + G(x)
F(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2

example:
f(x,y) = (ycos(xy) + 1, xcos(xy) + 1)
F_x = ycos(xy) + 1
F_y = xcos(xy) + 1

S ycos(xy) + 1 dx
= sin(xy) + x

S xcos(xy) + 1 dy
= sin(xy) + y

F(x,y) = sin(xy) + x + y

example:
f(x,y) = (2xy^-2, -2x^2y^-3)
F_x = 2xy^-2
F_y = -2x^2y^-3

S 2xy^-2 dx
= x^2/y^2

S -2x^2y^-3 dy
= x^2/y^2

F(x,y) = x^2/y^2

example:
f(x,y) = (10x + 2y, -2y + 2x)
F_x = 10x + 2y
F_y = -2y + 2x

S 10x + 2y dx
= 5x^2 + 2yx

S -2y + 2x
= -y^2 + 2yx

F(x,y) = 5x^2 + 2yx - y^2

Fundamental of theorem of line integrals also called gradient theorem:

S_a^b ∇f(r->(t))⋅r'->(t)dt = f(r->(b)) - f(r->(a))

review, fundamental theorem of calculus (in single variable world):

S_a^b g'(t)dt = g(b) - g(a)

S_a^b ∇f(r->(t))⋅r'->(t)dt
= S_a^b d/dt f(r->(t))
= f(r->(b)) - f(r->(a))

SOLUTION 1 (the old fashion way):
t = 0 to t = 2pi and r->[t sin(t)]

1) find derivatives of x,y
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 = [2x 2y]
2) find the derivatives of r(t)
[t sin(t)] -> [1 cos(t)]
3) plug in the values that you got from x,y and dot product it from the previous step
[2t 2sin(t)]⋅[1 cos(t)]
= (2t(1) + 2sin(t)cos(t))dt
4) take the integral
S_0^2pi (2t(1) + 2sin(t)cos(t))dt
= [t^2 + sin(t)^2] | from 0 to 2pi
= ((2pi)^2 + sin(2pi)^2) - ((0)^2 + sin(0)^2)
= 4pi^2

SOLUTION 2 (fundamental theorem of line intergrals):
t = 0 to t = 2pi r->[t sin(t)]

f(r->(2pi)) - f(r->0))
= f([2pi sin(2pi)]) - f([0 sin(0)])
=((2pi)^2 + sin(2pi)^2) - ((0)^2 + sin(0)^2)
= 4pi^2

=============================

double integrals polar:
1/xy = r^-2sec(theta)csc(theta)

for 3d cylinders we use 3 integrals of polar measuments
order matters because z depends on r
S_0^2pi S_0^1 S_?^? r dz dr dtheta.

for a given value of r the range of values for z is
-sqrt(1 - r^2) <= z <= sqrt(1 - r^2)

In cylindrical coordinates, the distance from a point (r, theta, z) to the origin is:
sqrt(r^2 + z^2)

To see why, relate to cartesian coordinates using the fact that r^2 = x^2 +y^2
sqrt(r^2 + z^2) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

Therefore, the unit sphere could be defined as all points such that:
r^2 + z^2 = 1^2

solving for z we get upper/lower bounds in the sphere
r^2 + z^2 = 1
z^2 = 1 - r^2
z = +/-sqrt(1 - r^2)

example a unit sphere:
S_0^2pi S_0^1 S_-sqrt(1-r^2)^sqrt(1-r^2) r dz dr dtheta
= S_0^2pi S_0^1 [rz] | -sqrt(1-r^2) to sqrt(1-r^2)
= S_0^2pi S_0^1 r(sqrt(1-r^2) - (-sqrt(1-r^2))) dr dtheta
= S_0^2pi S_0^1 2rsqrt(1 - r^2) dr dtheta

* Using the inverse chain rule, we can quickly scribble some notes to see what this antiderivative is:
* S 2rsqrt(1 - r^2) dr = 2r
* antiderivative of sqrt(something)
* 2/3(1 - r^2)^(3/2)
* divide by d/dr(1 - r^2)
* 1/-2r
= -2/3(1 - r^2)^(3/2)

continuing with a unit sphere
S_0^2pi S_0^1 2rsqrt(1 - r^2) dr dtheta
= S_0^2pi [-2/3(1 - r^2)^3/2] | 0 to 1
= S_0^2pi (-2/3(1 - (1)^2)^3/2 - (-2/3(1 - (0)^2)^3/2)) dtheta
= S_0^2pi (-2/3(0) - -2/3(1)) dtheta
= S_0^2pi 2/3 dtheta
= 4/3 pi

example pie shaped:
S_0^pi/4 S_0^2 S_0^tan(theta) (z - r^2)r dz dr dtheta
= S_0^pi/4 S_0^2 S_0^tan(theta) (zr - r^3) dz dr dtheta
= S_0^pi/4 S_0^2 [z^2/2(r) - r^3z] | 0 to tan(theta)
= S_0^pi/4 S_0^2 tan^2(theta)/2(r) - r^3tan(theta) dr dtheta

second
S_0^pi/4 S_0^2 tan^2(theta)/2(r) - r^3tan(theta) dr dtheta
= S_0^pi/4 [r^2tan^2(theta)/4 - r^4/4tan(theta)] | 0 to 2
= S_0^pi/4 2^2tan^2(theta)0/4 - 2^4/4tan(theta) dtheta
= S_0^pi/4 (tan^2(theta) - 4tan(theta)) dtheta

* couple notes for antiderivatives of tan
* The antiderivative of tan^2theta is tan(theta) - theta
* The antiderivative of tan(theta) is -ln(|cos(theta)|)

continuing pie shape
S_0^pi/4 (tan^2(theta) - 4tan(theta)) dtheta
= [tan(theta) - theta - 4(-ln(cos(theta)))] | 0 to pi/4
= [tan(theta) - theta + 4ln(cos(theta))] | o to pi/4
= (tan(pi/4) - pi/4 + 4ln(cos(pi/4))) - (tan(0) - 0 + 4ln(cos(0)))
= (1 - pi/4 + 4ln(sqrt(2)/2)) - (0 - 0 + 4ln(1))
= 1 - pi/4 + 4ln(sqrt(2)/2)

cylindrical
dV = r dtheta dr dz

sphereical coordinates
(r, o, theta) the tiny volume dV expanded:
SSS_R f(r, o, theta)
= SSS_R f(r, o, theta)(dr)(rdo)(rsin(o)dtheta)
= SSS_R f(r, o, theta)r^2sin(o) dtheta do dr

example:
S_0^2pi S_0^pi S_0^R r^2sin(o) dr do dtheta
= S_0^2pi S_0^pi [r^3/3sin(o)] | 0 to R
= S_0^2pi S_0^pi R^3/3sin(o) do dtheta

second layer
S_0^2pi S_0^pi R^3/3sin(o) do dtheta
= S_0^2pi [R^3/3(-cos(o))] | 0 to pi
= S_0^2pi (R^3/3(-cos(pi) - (-cos(0))))dtheta
= S_0^2pi R^3/3(2) dtheta

third layer
S_0^2pi R^3/3(2) dtheta
= [R^3/3(2)(theta)] | 0 to 2pi
= R^3/3(2)(2pi)
= 4/3piR^3

If you are integrating over a region with some spherical symmetry, passing to spherical coordinates can make the bounds much nicer to deal with than cartesian coordinates.
(useful for getting our bounds to be constants)

expessing a function in spherical coordinate
converting a function:
f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + 3z

x = rsin(o)cos(theta)
y = rsin(o)sin(theta)
z = rcos(o)

= rsin(o)cos(theta) + 2rsin(o)sin(theta) + 3rcos(o)
= r(sin(o)cos(theta) + 2sin(o)sin(theta) + 3cos(o))

example w/ bounds:
S_0^pi/2 S_0^pi/2 S_0^sqrt(3) r(sin(o)cos(theta) + 2sin(o)sin(theta) + 3cos(o))r^2sin(o) dr dtheta do
= S_0^pi/2 S_0^pi/2 (sin(o)cos(theta) + 2sin(o)sin(theta) + 3cos(o))sin(o) [r^4/4] | 0 to sqrt(3) dtheta do
= S_0^pi/2 S_0^pi/2 (sin(o)cos(theta) + 2sin(o)sin(theta) + 3cos(o))sin(o) (sqrt(3)^4/4) dtheta do

second layer
= 9/4 S_0^pi/2 sin(o) S_0^pi/2 (sin(o)cos(theta) + 2sin(o)sin(theta) + 3cos(o)) dtheta do
= 9/4 S_0^pi/2 sin(o)[sin(o)sin(theta) + 2sin(o)(-cos(theta)) + 3cos(o)] | 0 to pi/2
= 9/4 S_0^pi/2 sin(o) (sin(o)(1-0) + 2sin(o)(-(0 - 1)) + 3cos(o)(pi/2 - 0)) do
= 9/4 S_0^pi/2 sin(o)(sin(o) + 2sin(o) + 3pi/2cos(o)) do
= 9/4 S_0^pi/2 (3sin^2(o) + 3pi/2cos(o)sin(o)) do

* Looking up antiderivatives:
* antiderivative of sin^2(o) is o/2 - 1/2(cos(o)sin(o))
* antiderivative of cos(o)sin(o) is -1/2(cos^2(o))

third layer:
9/4 S_0^pi/2 (3sin^2(o) + 3pi/2cos(o)sin(o)) do
= 9/4[3(o/2 - 1/2(cos(o)sin(o))) + 3pi/2(-1/2cos^2(o))] | 0 to pi/2
= 9/4(3(pi/4 - 0) + 3pi/2(1/2))
= 9/4(3pi/4 + 3pi/4)
= 9/4(3pi/2)
= 27pi/8

Parametrization of a torus

z(s,t) = a sin s
x(s,t) = (sint)(b + acos s)
y(s,t) = (cost)(b + acos s)

r->(s, t) = (b + acos s)sint i + (b + acos s)(cost) j + a sin s k
r->(pi/2, pi/2) = bi + oj + ak = bi + ak

======================

Finding area of elements:
take the derivative of theta and sigma then find its determinate of v->(theta, sigma)
for this we will use theta as x and sigma as y
and put there vectors 

v->(x, y) = (rcos(x)sin(y), rsin(x)sin(y), rcos(y))
(i, j, k)

we are given r = 2
theta = pi
sigma = pi/3

∂v->/∂theta x ∂v->/∂sigma
here we'll just use x and y
∂v->/∂x x ∂v->/∂y

derivatives from above
det(
	i [
		-rsin(x)sin(y)
		rccos(x)cos(y)]
	j [
		rcos(x)sin(y)
		rsin(x)cos(y)]
	k [
		0
		-rsin(y)
	]
)

= (-r^2cos(x)sin^2(y) - 0)i + (-r^2sin(x)sin^2(y) - 0)j
+ (-r^2sin^2(x)cos(y)sin(y) - r^2cos^2(x)cos(y)sin(y))k
= (-r^2cos(x)sin^2(y))i + (-r^2sin(x)sin^2(y))j + (-r^2cos(y)sin(y))k

plugging in r, theta (x), sigma (y)

= (-(2)^2cos(pi)sin^2(pi/3))i
+ (-(2)^2sin(pi)sin^2(pi/3))j
+ (-(2)^2cos(pi/3)sin^2(pi/3))k

= (3)i + (-sqrt(3))k
= (3, 0, -sqrt(3))

example:
(-(5)^2cos(pi/2)sin^2(2pi/3))i 
+ (-(5)^2sin(pi/2)sin^2(2pi/3))j
+ (-(5)^2cos(2pi/3)sin^2(2pi/3))k

= (0, -75/4. 25sqrt(3)/4)

final step to check if points are inward or outwards.
We know that a sphere's outward facing normal vector points
directly away from the origin because:

theta = pi/2 and sigma = 2pi/3
correspond to a zero 0, positive y and negative z, we need to reverse the signs of out calculation to make it match outward normal vector

= (0, 75/4, -25sqrt(3)/4)


example:
= (9cos(2pi/3)sin^2(pi/2))i
+ (9sin(2pi/3)sin^2(pi/2))j
+ (9cos(pi/2)sin^2(pi/2))k

cos(2pi/3) = -1/2
sin(2pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2
cos(pi/2) = 0

Calculating a surface integral

∂->r/∂s = -asin(t)sin(s) i - acos(t)sin(s) j + acos(s) k
∂->r/∂t = (b + acos(s))cos(t) i - (b + acos(s))sin(t) j + 0 k

∂->r/∂s x ∂r->/∂t = [
	i [
		-asin(t)sin(s)
		(b + acos(s))cos(t)

	j [
		-acos(t)sin(s)
		-(b + acos(s))sin(t)
	]
	k [

∂->r/∂s x ∂r->/∂t
(leaving out 0s and - to positives)
i acos(s)(b + acos(s))sin(t) + j (b + acos(s))cos(t)acos(s)
+ k (asin(t)sin(s))(b + acos(s))sin(t) + acos(t)sin(s)(b + acos(s))cos(t)

factored:
= (b + acos(s))[acos(s)sin(t)i + acos(s)cos(t)j + asin(s)sin^2(t) + asin(s)cos^2(t)k]
unit vector k can be factored more:
asin(s)(sin^2(t) + cos^2(t))k
= asin(s)(1)k
= asin(s)k

altogether
= (b + acos(s))[acos(s)sin(t)i + acos(s)cos(t)j + asin(s)k]

finding the magnitude of the cross product (from above)
∂->r/∂s x ∂r->/∂t
(of course using the most basic trig identity cos^2 + sin^2 = 1)
= (b + acos(s))[a^2cos^2(s)sin^2(t) + a^2cos^2(s)cos^2(t) + a^2sin^2(s)]^(1/2)
= (b + acos(s))[(a^2cos^2(s))(sin^2(t) + cos^2(t)) + a^2sin^2(s)]^(1/2)
= (b + acos(s))[a^2cos^2(s) + a^2sin^2(s)]^(1/2)
= (b + acos(s))[a^2(cos^2(s) + sin^2(s))]^(1/2)
= (b + acos(s))[a^2]^(1/2)
= (b + acos(s))[a]

so we end up with:
∂->r/∂s x ∂r->/∂t = ab + a^2cos(s)

Now lets integrate:
S_0^2pi S_0^2pi ab + a^2cos(s) ds dt

Surface integral (a cylinder cut at an angle)
SS_S z dS
S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3
SS_S z dS = SS_s1 dS + SS_s2 dS + SS_s3 dS

SURFACE 2:

* Lets break this up into 3 speparate integral

* cos^2u = 1/2 + 1/2(cos2u)

= 1/2[S_0^2pi du - 2 S_0^2pi cosu du + S_0^2pi (1/2 + 1/2(cos2u)) du]

* A different way to write 1/2(cos2u)
* 1/4(2cos2u)

u | 0 to 2pi = 2pi
-2[sinu] | 0 to 2pi = 0
[1/2u + 1/4(sin2u)] | 0 to 2pi = pi
= 1/2[2pi + pi]
= 3pi/2

======================

Computing a surface integral is almost identical to computing surface area using a double integral, except that you stick a function inside the integral

SS_T f(v->(t, s))|∂v->/∂t x ∂v->/∂s| dt ds

======================

A curve is simple if it never crosses itself
closed if it starts and ends in the same place
Piecewise-smooth if it can be broken up into finitie number of smooth parts
(Smooth means differentiable)

A region is simply connected if it never intersects itself and it has no holes

Greens Theorm
(closed interval)
S_c P dx + Q dy = SS_R (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y)dA

To apply the Green's theorm trick we first need to find a pair of functions
P(x,y) and Q(x,y) which satisfy the following property
∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 1

you can compute an area of a region around its counterclockwise boundary
S_c 1/2(x dy - y dx)

we swaped dx and dy when we took the dertiminate of derivatives
(memory trick)
[
	[   i       j
		∂/∂x    ∂/∂y
		P(x,y)  Q(x, y)
	]
]

often times F is written component-wise
F(x,y) = P(x,y)i + Q(x,y)j

example:
x^2y dx - y^2 dy
P(x,y) = x^2y
Q(x,y) = -y^2
∂Q/∂x = 0
∂P/∂y = x^2

if you need to find bounds from a function make sure to find:
x1
x2
y1(x)
y2(x)

An example of finding region
We are given y1 (upper) = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1)
We are given y2 (lower) = (4 - x^2)

we dont know x1 or x2 so we have to either look
at the graph and see where they intersect or
just set both y's equal and solve for x
(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1) = 4 - x^2
then the intergral is setup like this:
= S_-2^2 S_(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1)^(4 - x^2)

since its clockwise we have to make this negative:
-(∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) = ∂P/∂y - ∂Q/∂x

= S_-2^2 (S_(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1)^(4 - x^2) (∂P/∂y - ∂Q/∂x) dy) dx
= S_-2^2 (S_(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1)^(4 - x^2) (x^2 - 0) dy) dx <- factored
= S_-2^2 (x^2 S_(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1)^(4 - x^2) dy) dx
= S_-2^2 x^2 ((4 - x^2) - (x^2 - 4)(x^2 -1)) dx
= S_-2^2 x^2 (4 - x^2)(-1 - (x^2 - 1)) dx
= S_-2^2 -x^4(x^2 - 4) dx
= S_-2^2 -(x^6 - 4x^4) dx
= S_-2^2 4x^4 - x^6 dx
= [(4)x^5/5 - x^7/7] | -2 to 2
= ((4)2^5/5 - 2^7/7) - ((4)-2^5/5 - -2^7/7)
= ((4)32/5 - 128/7) -((4)-32/5 - -128/7)
= 2((4)32/5 - 128/7)
= 2(128/5 - 128/7)
= 256(1/5 - 1/7)
= 256(7/35 - 5/35)
= 256(2/35)
= 512/35

example:
S_c (3x^2 + x^3) dx + cos(xy^2) dy
P(x,y) = 3x^2 + x^3
Q(x,y) = cos(xy^2)

find ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y
Q_x = -y^2sin(xy^2)
P_y = 0

problem states its negative orientated so
solution is simply:
y^2sin(xy^2)

example:
SS_R ye^x + x^2y^2 dA
integrate to find S_c

P(x,y) = x^2y^2 = (-x^2y^3/3)
Q(x,y) = ye^x

S_y = (x^2y^3/3)
S_x = ye^x

reverse the x,y becomes
S_c (x^2y^3/3) dx - ye^x dy

example:
SS_R 4x^2y^3 - 3y^2x^3 dA

P(x,y) = 3y^2x^3
Q(x,y) = 4x^2y^3

S_y = x^3y^3 <- P with respect to y
S_x = (4x^3y^3/3) <- Q with respect to x

S_c = x^3y^3 dx + (4x^3y^3/3) dy

======================

little review:
antiderivative increases the power
derivative descreases

======================

Normal form of Green theorm

example:
S_c cos(xy) dx + sin(xy) dy

-Q dx + P dy = SS_R (∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y)

P(x,y) = sin(xy)
Q(x,y) = -cos(xy)

now find ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y

P_x = ycos(xy)
Q_y = xsin(xy)

∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y = ycos(xy) + xsin(xy)

SS_R ycos(xy) + xsin(xy) dA

example:
S_c x/y^2 dx + 4ln(x^2y)

P(x,y) = 4ln(x^2y)
Q(x,y) = -x/y^2

∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y

P_x = 4/x^y (2xy) = 8/x
Q_y = 2x/y^3

∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y = 8/x + 2x/y^3
because C is negatively orientated:
-(P_x + Q_y)

= -8/x - 2x/y^3

example:
S_c 4^2cos(y^2) dx + xsin(y^2)

P(x,y) = xsin(y^2)
Q(x,y) = -4x^2cos(y^2)

∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y
P_x = sin(y^2)
P_y = 8x^2ysin(y^2)

∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y = (1 + 8x^2y)sin(y^2)
SS_R (1 + 8x^2y)sin(y^2) dA

example:
SS_R 6xy^2 + 2xy dA

P(x,y) = 3x^2y^2
Q(x,y) = xy^2

it negative so Qdx - Pdy instead of -Qdx + Pdy
S_c = xy^2 dx - 3x^2y^2 dy

example:
SS_R sin(x + y) - cos(x - y) dA

P(x,y) = -cos(x + y)
Q(x,y) = sin(x - y)

S_c -sin(x - y)dx - cos(x + y)dy

======================

Stokes Theorem

n = k

= SS_R (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA <- Green's Theorm (a special case for Stokes Theorem)

In order for stokes to hold you can think of it like this
if a vector is pointing up and a person is on the boundry the
opposide side of the boundry is always to the left and head points in the
direction of the vector and vise versa

Or think of how you take off a bottle cap, twist to right it goes up
twist to left it goes down.

======================

review
trig identities

sin^3(x)
= sin(x)(1 - cos^2(x))
= sin(x) - sin(x)cos^2(x)

= 1/2(1 + cos2(x))
= 1/2 + 1/2 cos2(x) <- easier to take the derivative

flux problem - how much fluid passes through a surface given the velocity vector field of that fluid.

Gauss Theorem is another name for the divergence theorem

2D divergence
S_C F⋅n ds = SS_R div F dA
often the component functions of F(x,y):

F(x,y) = [P(x,y) Q(x,y)]

if you write 2D diverdence theorem in terms of P and Q:
S_C Pdy - Qdx = SS_R ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y

2D divergence theorm is secretly just saying the same thing as Green's theorem.

Greens Theorem
S_C Pdx + Qdy = SS_R (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA

∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y represents the 2 dimensional curl of F

Applying Greens theorrm to the flux integral
S_C Pdy - Qdx

first start with Greens Theorem:
S_C Pdx + Qdy = SS_R (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA

next replace P with -Q and Q with P:
S_C -Qdx + Pdy = SS_R (∂P/∂x - ∂(-Q)/∂y) dA

rearrage the last step:
S_C Pdy - Qdx  = SS_R (∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y) dA

the expression inside the double integral from previous
step is indeed the divergence of F:
div F = div [P(x,y) Q(x,y)] = ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y

SSS_V div F dV = SS_S F⋅n
divergence measures outward flow of a fluid at individual points, flux measures outward fluid flow form an entire region. Adding up bits of divergence is the same value as flux.

divergence only applies to closed boundaries

Take a surface integral of a vector field, this always means taking the dot product with the unit normal vector to that surface:
SS_S (v-> ⋅ n)

This is so universal that it goes without saying the unit normal vector is involved, so people drop n and write:
SS_S (v->)

example a cube sitting on origin with 6 faces:
SS_S (2yi + 3y^2j + 4zk)
= S_0^1 S_0^1 S_0^1 ∇ ⋅ (2yi + 3y^2j + 4zk) dx dy dz

(column vectors but displayed here as rows to save space)
∇ = [∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z]
[∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z] ⋅ [2y 3y^2 4z]
= ∂/∂x(2y) ∂/∂y(3y^2) ∂/∂z(4z)
= 0 + 6y + 4

integrate
S_0^1 S_0^1 S_0^1 (6y + 4) dx dy dz
= S_0^1 S_0^1 S_0^1 (6y + 4) dx dy dz
= 4 + S_0^1 S_0^1 S_0^1 6y dx dy dz

* S_0^1 S_0^1 dx dz = 1

= 4 + S_0^1 6y dy
= 4 + [3y^2] | 0 to 1
= 4 + 3 = 7




surface integral through a cylinder
example cylinder sitting on middle origin radius 3 height 5:
surface integral
SS_S [x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y3)]

∇ ⋅ [x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y3)]
= 3x^2 + 3y^2
= 3(x^2 + y^2)

= SSS_C 3(x^2 + y^2) dV

Since we are integrating over a cylinder its very natural to use cylindrical coordinates, to do this:

first step:
replace dV with r dtheta dr dz

second step:
replace x^2 + y^2 with r^2

third:
set bounds on our cylinder
r ranges from 0 to 3
theta ranges from 0 to 2pi
z ranges from 0 to 5

S_0^5 S_0^3 S_0^2pi (3r^2)r dtheta dr dz
= 3 S_0^5 S_0^3 S_0^2pi r^3 dtheta dr dz
= 3 S_0^3 r^3 S_0^5 S_0^2pi dtheta dz dr <- = 2pi
= 3(2pi) S_0^3 r^3 S_0^5 dz dr <- = 5
= 3(2pi)(5) S_0^3 r^3 dr
= 3(2pi)(5) [1/4(r^4)] | 0 to 3
= 3(2pi)(5) (1/4(3^4) - 1/4(0^4))
= (3(2pi)(5)(3^4)/4)
= 1,215pi/2

The divergence theorem is useful whenever the interior volume of a region is easier to describe than its surface.

it also helps the divergence of the relevant vector field turns it into a simpler function

======================

Differential equations

example:
(x + 1)^2y' + e^-y = 0

first find derivative of y:
we are given:
y = ln(1 / x + 1) + C

= -ln(x + 1)
y' = -1/x + 1

plug in the values for y:
(x + 1)^2y' + e^-y
= (x + 1)^2(-1 / (x + 1)) + e^(ln(x + 1) - C)
cancels out exp 2 and the denominator (x + 1)
= -(x + 1) + e^(ln + 1) * e^-C
= -(x + 1) + (x + 1)e^-C
= (e^-C - 1)(x + 1)

to make the right side of the equation 0 polynomial, the coefficient of x + 1 must be 0 this happens only when C = 0 not for all C. So lets find the other example:
(notice the C this time is on the inside)
y = ln(1 / (x + 1) + C)
y' = 1/(1/(x + 1) + C) * (-1/(x + 1)^2)

lets see if it simplifies to 0
plug in y'
(x + 1)^2y' + e^-y
= (x + 1)^2(-1 / (x + 1) + C(x + 1)^2) + e^-(ln(1/x+1 + C))
= -(x + 1)^2/((x + 1) + C(x + 1)^2) + 1/(1/(x+1))+C

multiply C(x + 1)^2) + 1/(1/(x+1))+C by ((x + 1)/(x + 1))
= -(x + 1)/(1 + C(x + 1)) + (x + 1)/(1 + C(x + 1))
= 0

we found a solution that is valid
use the condition y(0) = 0 x = 0 and y = 0
y = ln(1/(x + 1) + C)
0 = ln(1 + C)
1 = 1 + C
C = 0

======================

which one of the following families of functions solves the differential equation
y' = -2xy^2
for all values of the constant C we have:
y = -1/(x^2) + C
y = -1/(x^2 + C)
y = 1/(x^2 + C)
y = 1/(x^2) + C

lets cut our work in half using constant S = +/-1
now we can check 2 functions instead of 4
y = S/(x^2) + C and y = S/(x^2 + C)

We can quickly rule out one solution because the additive constant C disappears when we differentiate it
y = S/(x^2) + C
y' = -2S/x^3

Can you spot what goes wrong when we substitute y and y' into the equation?
y' = -2xy^2
-2S/x^3 = -2x(S/(x^2) + C)^2
S/x^4 = (S/(x^2) + C)^2

The right side has degree 2 and the left 0, different polynomial functions of C. A quadratic equation in C has at most two real solutions so the equation cannot possibly be true for all values of C

We need to be able to cancel the same expression in C from both sides.
Lets now use the other family
y = S/(x^2  + C)
y' = 2Sx/(x^2 + C)^2

substitute y and y'
y' = -2xy^2
-2Sx/(x^2 + C)^2 = -2x(S/(x^2 + C))^2
S/(x^2 + C)^2 = S^2/(x^2 + C)^2
S/(x^2 + C)^2 = 1/(x^2 + C)^2  <- S^2 implies 1

cancel both denominators (x^2 + C)^2
S = 1

======================

There are two values of a that make y = e^(2ax) a solution to the following equation:
y'' + 4y' + 3y = 0

what is the sum of these two values?
y' = 2ae^(2ax)
y'' = 4a^2e^(2ax)

substitute
4a^2e^(2ax) + 8ae^(2ax) + 3e^(2ax) = 0
= (4a^2 + 8a + 3)e^(2ax) = 0

since an exponential can never equal 0 the polynomial factor must be 0
4a^2 + 8a + 3 = 0

factor:
(2a + 3)(2a + 1) = 0
a = -3/2 or a = -1/2
-3/2 - 1/2 = -2

======================

Which two families of functions solves:
2x^2y' + e^-y = 0

for all values fo the constant C
y = ln(1/2x + C)
y = ln(1/2x) + C
satify this condition:
y(1) = ln3

calculate y'
y = ln(1/2x + C)
= -ln(2x) + C
= -ln2 - lnx + C
y' = -1/x

plug in y for
2x^2y' + e^-y
= 2x^2(-1/x) + e^(ln(2x) - C)
= -2x + e^(ln(2x)) * e^-C
= -2x + 2xe^-C
= (e^-C - 1)2x

To make the right side of the equation be the 0 poloynomial, the coefficient of x must be 0. This happens only when C = 0, not for all C. Next!
y = ln(1/2x + C)

y' = 1/((1/2x) + C) * (-1/2x^2)
= -1/(x + 2Cx^2)

lets see if this simplifies to 0
2x^2y' + e^-y
= 2x^2(-1/(x + 2Cx^2)) + e^(-ln(1/2x) + C)
= -2x^2/(x + 2Cx^2) + 1/(1/(2x) + C)

multiply 1/(1/(2x) + C) by 2x/2x
= -2x/(1 + 2Cx) + 2x/(1 + 2Cx)
= 0

remember let y(1) = ln3, x = 1, and y = ln3
y = ln(1/(2x) + C)
ln3 = ln(1/2 + C)
3 = 1/2 + C
C = 5/2

2 = 1/2 + C

======================

which one of the following families of functions solves the differential equation
y' = -y^2

y = 1/(x + C)

======================

1) Calculate y' for a given y
2) Write y' so we can easily identify y as a factor, term, or divsor.
3) Rewrite y' in terms of y to find the matching differential equation.

y = ce^(3x)
y' = ce^(3x) * 3
replace ce^(3x) with y:
y' = 3y

y = ce^x - x - 1
y' = ce^x - 1
y' = x + removed : ce^x - x - 1 <- also removed added an x
y' = x + y

y = sqrt(C - x^2)
y' = 1/2sqrt(C - x^2) * (-2x)
removed sqrt(C - x^2) and replaced with y
y' = -x/y

======================

Which one of the following two families of functions solves the differential equation:
x^2y' + e^-y = 0

y = ln(1/x + C)
y = ln(1/x) + C

satisfy condition y(1) = ln2
y = ln(1/x) + C
= -lnx + C
y' = -1/x

plugging in:
x^2y' + e^-y
= x^2(-1/x) + e^(lnx - C)
= -x + e^(lnx) * e^-C
= -x + xe^-C
= (e^-C - 1)x


Next candidate (for reasons described above):
y = ln(1/x + C)
ln2 = ln(1 + C)
2 = 1 + C
C = 1

======================

There are three values of a that make
y = a/x
a solution of the following differential equation
y^3 + yy' - y'' = 0

y' = -a/x^2
y'' = 2a/x^3

Substitution
(a/x)^3 + a/x(-a/x^2) - 2a/x^3 = 0

simplify
a^3/x^3 - a^2/x^3 - 2a/x^3 = 0

factor
(a^2 - a - 3)a/x^3 = 0

since 1/x^3 can never equal 0, the polynomial factor must be 0
(a^2 - a - 2)a = 0

factor polynomial
(a + 1)(a - 2)a = 0

a = -1, a = 2, or a = 0

the question wants us to sum all known values:
-1 + 2 + 0 = 1

======================

f'(x) = -f(x) + x - 1
statisfies the condition f(2) = 1

f'(2) = -f(2) + 2 - 1
f'(2) = -1 + 2 - 1 = 0
f'(2) is zero
since f'(2) os zero f has a critical point at 2

substitute x = 2 into the equation and use the value of the first derivative to get the value of the second derivative
f''(2) = -f'(2) + 1
= 0 + 1
= 1

since f''(2) is positive, f is concave up and thus has a local min at the critical point 2

======================

x^3y' - e^y = 0
for y(1) = -ln3

y = -ln(1/(2x^2 + C))
-ln3 = -ln((1/2 + C))
3 = 1/2 + C
C = 5/2

======================

There are two values of a that make y = e^(ax) with the equation
y'' - y' - 30y = 0

y' = ae^(ax)
y'' = a^2e^(ax)

substitution
a^2e^(ax) - ae^(ax) - 30e^(ax) = 0

factor
(a^2 - a - 30)e^(ax) = 0


since exponential can never equal 0, the polynomial factor must be 0
a^2 - a - 30 = 0

factor
(x + 5)(a - 6) = 0

a = -5 or a = 6

question wants us to sum
-5 + 6 = 1

======================

The differential equation
y' = 2x + 3y + 1
has a solution in the form y = mx + b
what are the values for m and b?

substitute
m = 2x + 3(mx + b) + 1
0x + m = (2 + 3m)x + 3b + 1

now equate the coefficients of x and constant terms
0 = 2 + 3m
m = 3b + 1

the first equation gives us m = -2/3 substitute this into the second equation and solve for b
-2/3 = 3b + 1
3b = -5/3
b = -5/9

m = -2/3
b = -5/9

======================

f'(x) = f(x) + 3x

statisfies the condition f(1) = 0

f'(1) = f(1) + 3*1
= 0 + 3
= 3
since f'(1) is positive f is increasing at 1

f''(1) = f'(1) + 3
= 3 + 3
= 6
since f''(1) is positive f is concave up at 1

======================

Exact equations
M(x,y) + N(x,y) = 0
= ∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x = 0

example:
(3x^2 - 2xy + 2) + (6y^2 - x^2 + 3)dy/dx = 0
M_y = -2x
N_x = -2x

Ψ_x = 3x^2 - 2xy + 2

take antiderivative of both sides
Ψ = x^3 - x^2y + 2x + h(y)

next solve for h(y)
Ψ_y = -x^2 + h'(y) = 6y^2 - x^2 + 3

simplify
h'(y) = 6y^2 + 3

antiderivative
h(y) = 2y^3 + 3y

Ψ(x,y) = x^3 - x^2y + 2x + 2y^3 + 3

for the y' we used the chain rule
(d/dx f(y) = f'(y)dy/dx when y is a function of x)
d/dx Ψ(x,y) = 3x^2 - (2xy + x^2y') + 2 + 6y^2y' + 3y'

simplify
= 3x^2 - 2xy + 2 - y'(-x^2 + 6y^2 + 3)

notice this now looks like the original equation
= (3x^2 - 2xy + 2) + (6y^2 - x^2 + 3)y' = 0
d/dx Ψ(x,y) = 0
Ψ(x,y) = C
x^3 - x^2y + 2x + 2y^3 + 3y = C

If equations are not exact maybe we can multiply both sides of the equations by a factor/function 
example:
(3xy + y^2)(x^2 + xy)y' = 0
M_y = 3x + 2y
N_x = 2x + y

not equal so (m() = greek mu):
m(x)(3xy + y^2) + m(x)(3xy + y^2)y' = 0
= m(x)(3x + 2y) = m'(x)(x^2 + xy) + m(x)(2x + y)

solving for m(x) yeilds:
1/x dx = 1/m dm
=> m(x) = x
which means when taking M_y and N_x we add an x to all x terms to make them equal:
M_y = 3x + 2y
N_x = 2x + y

(3x^2y + xy^2) + (x^3 + x^2y)y' = 0
= 3x^2 + 2xy = 3x^2 + 2xy

homogeneous equations
F(y/x)
Ay'' + By' + Cy = 0 <- 0 makes it homogeneous

example:
y'' + 5y' + 6y = 0

we can make y = e^(rx)
y = e^(rx)
y' = re^(rx)
y'' = r^2e^(rx)

r^2e^(rx) + 5re^(rx) + 6e^(rx) = 0
e^(rx)(r^2 + 5r + 6) = 0
r^2 + 5r + 6 = 0
(r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
r = -2, r = -3
y1 = e^(-2x)
y2 = e^(-3x)
y(x) = C_1e^(-2x) + C_2e^(-3x)

y(0) = 2
y'(0) = 3
y(0) = 2 = C_1 + C_2
y'(x) = -2C_1e^(-2x) - 3C_2e^(-3x)
y'(0) = 3 = -2C_1 - 3C_2

C_1 + C_2 = 2
-2C - 3C_2 = 3

multiply the first equation by 2x
-2C_1 - 3C_2 = 3
2C_1 + 2C_2 = 4
= -C_2 = 7
= C_2 = -7

substituting back in to solve for C_1
C_1 - 7 = 2
C_1 = 9

altogether
y(x) = 9e^(-2x) - 7e^(-3x)

review:
ALWAYS remember if something is not trivial to factor use the quadratic formula!

eulers formula:

e^(ix) = cosx + isinx

trig identities
cos - theta = costheta
sin - theta = -sintheta

finding complex roots:
if there is a negative under the square root sign
for a quadratic equation that means there are complex roots example:

characteristic equations:
y'' + y' + y = 0
r^2 + r + 1 = 0

r = lamba +/- mu i

(-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4))/2
r = -1/2 +/- i(sqrt(3)/2)

general formula:
y = e^(lambda x)(C_3 cosmu x + C_4 sinmu x)

plugging everything in:
y = e^(-1/2x)(C_1cos(sqrt(3)/2 x) + C_2sin(sqrt(3)/2 x))

the whole point is coming up with an equation that removes the imaginary part but can be used in the intermediate steps

======================

Laplace transform
are great for solving linear differential equations, so they're used for analyzing linear systems such as temperature control systems or shock absorbers.

Fourier transforms are best suited for signal processing applications such as radio propagation and image processing.
In the digital world, there are equivalent transforms (z-transform for Laplace, discrete-time Fourier for Fourier).

L{f(t)}
= S_0^infinity e^(-st)(f(t)) dt

L{f'(t)}
= s L{f(t)} - f(0)

L{e^(at)}
= 1/s-a if s > a

L{1}
= S_0^infinity e^(-st) dt
= [-1/s e^(-st)] | 0 to infinity
= 0 - (-1/s)
= 1/s if s > 0

review integration by parts
derivative of product rule
d/dt(uv) = u'v + uv'

integrate
uv = S u'v + S uv'
S u'v = uv - S uv'

example
L{sin(at)}
= S_0^infinity e^(-st)sin(at)dt = y
u' = e^(-et)
u = -1/s e^(-st)
v = sin(at)
v' = acos(at)

y = -1/s e^(-st)sin(at) - S_0^infinity -1/se^(-st)acos(at)
y = -e^(-st)/s sin(at) + a/s S_0^infinity e^(-st)cos(at) dt

u = -1/s(e^(-st))
u' = e^(-st)
v = cos(at)
v' = -asin(at)

y = -e^(-st)/s sin(at) + a/s[-1/s e^(-st)cos(at) - S_0^infinity 1/s e^(-st) asin(at) dt]
y = -e^(-st)/s sin(at) - a/s^2 e^(-st)cos(at) - a^2/s^2 S e^(-st)sin(at) dt
notice the end of the above is the same as our original we can replace with y

y + a^s/s^2 y = -e^(-st)(1/s sin(at) + a/s^2 cos(at))
= ((s^2 + a^2)/s^2)y = [-e^(-st)(1/s sin(at) + a/s^2 cos(at))] | 0 to infinity
= 0 + 1(0 + a/s^2)
((s^2 + a^2)/s^2)y = a/s^2
y = a/s^2 * s^2/(s^2 + a^2)
= a/(s^2 + a^2)

L{cos(at)}
= s L{1/a sin(at)} - 1/a sin 0
= s/a L{sin(at)}
= s/a * a/(s^2 + a^2)
= s/(s^2 + a^2)

L{f}
= 1/s{L{f'} + f(0)}

L{f'}
= s L{f} - f(0)
= L{f'} + f(0)
= s L{f}

L{t}
= S_0^infinity e^(-st)t dt
* d/dt uv = u'v + uv'
* uv = S u'v + S uv'
* S uv' = uv - Su'v
* v' = e^(-st)
* u = t
* v = -1/s e^(-st)
* u' = 1
L{t}
= [t(-1/s e^(-st))] | 0 to infinity - S_0^infinity 1 -1/s e^(-st) dt
= [-t/s e^(-st)] | 0 to infinity + 1/s S_0^infinity e^(-st) dt
= limA->infinity (-A/s e^(-SA)) + (0/s e^(-s0)) + 1/s L{1}
both terms evaulate to 0 so
L{t} = 1/s(L{1})
= 1/s^2  s > 0

L{t}
= 1/s L{1} + 0
= 1/s^2

L{t^2}
= 1/s L{2t}
= 2/s L{t}
= 2/s^3

L{t^3}
= 1/s L{3t^2}
= 3/s L{t^2}
= (3*2)/s^4

IN GENERAL:
L{t^n}
= n!/s^(n+1)

L{y''}
= s L{y'} - y'(0)
= s(s L{y} - y(0)) - y'(0)
= s^2 L{y} - s*y(0) - y'(0)

L{y''''}
= s^4 L{y} - s^3*y(0) - s^2*y'(0) - s*y''(0) - y'''(0)

some notation of the Laplace transform you'll sometimes see
L{y(t)} = Y(s)
L{f(t)} = F(s)
s represents the frequency domain

Laplace transform of the unit step function

if you want to shift a function to a particular point

L{µ_c(t)f(t-c)}
= S_0^infinify e^(-st)µ_c(t)f(t-c) dt

since we want our function to only matter at c 
and ignore everything before c we can start at c
so our µ_c(t) (our step becomes 1 at c, 0 before that)
x = t - c
t = x + c

= S_c^infinify e^(-st)f(t-c) dt
= S_c^infinify e^(-s(x + c))f(t-c) dt
= S_0^infinify e^(-s(x + c))f(x) dx
= S_0^infinify e^(-sx - sc)f(x) dx
= S_0^infinify e^(-sx)e^(-sc)f(x) dx
= e^(-sc) S_0^infinify e^(-sx)f(x) dx

= e^(-sc)L{f(t)}

review:
L{f(t)} = F(s)
L{µ_c(t)f(t-c)} = e^(-sc)F(s)
L{e^(at)f(t)} = F(s - a)
L{1} = 1/s
L{t^n} = n!/s^(n+1)
L{sin at} = a/(s^2 - a^2)
L{cos at} = s/(s^2 + a^2)

======================

Dirac's Delta

A Dirac's Delta function could be used to model/measure
an instantaneous spike in a graph (a quick change that happens instantly). Another way to think of it is a derivative of a step function.

D(t - c) = {0 when t != c, "infinity" when t = c}

S_-infinity^infinity D(t - c) dt = 1

======================

Laplace transfor to solve a nonhomogeneous:
y'' + y = sin2t
y(0) = 2
y'(0) = 1

L{y} = Y(s)
L{sinat} = a/(s^2 + a^2)

L{y''} = s^2*L{y} - sy(0) - y'(0) = s^2*Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)
= s^2*Y(s) - 2s - 1 + Y(s) = 2/(s^2 + 4)
= (s^2 + 1)Y(s) - 2s - 1 = 2/(s^2 + 4)
= (s^2 + 1)Y(s) = 2/(s^2 + 4) + 2s + 1
= Y(s) = 2/(s^2 + 4)(s^2 + 1) + 2s/(s^2 + 1) + 1/(s^2 + 1)

* Lets use partial fraction decomposition for
* 2/(s^2 + 4)(s^2 + 1)
* (As+B)/(s^2+4) + (Cs+D)/(s^2+1)
* = (As+B)(s^2+1)+(Cs+D)(s^2+4)/(s^2+4)(s^2+1) 
* As^3 + As + Bs^2 + B
* Cs^3 + 4Cs + Ds^2 + 4D
* = (A+C)s^3 + (B+D)s^2 + (A+4C)s + (B+4D)/(s^2+4)(s^2+1)
* USING OUR ORIGINAL 2/(s^2 + 4)(s^2 + 1)
* FIND NUMERATOR
* A + C = 0
* A + 4C = 0
* = 0 - 3C = 0
* C = 0, A = 0
* B + D = 0
* B + 4D = 2
* 0 - 3D = -2
* D = 2/3, B = -D, B = -2/3

= (-2 / 3) / (s^2 + 4) + (2 / 3) / (s^2 + 1)
= Y(s) = -1/3(2/(s^2+4)) + 2/3(1/(s^2+1)) + 2(s/s^2+1) + 1/(s^2+1)
= y(t) = -1/3(sin2t) + 2/3(sin) + 2cost + 2sint
y(t) = -1/3(sin2t) + 5/3(sint) + 2cost

======================

review trig identity (if I write these enough I should remember them eventually)
cos^2τ = 1/2(1 + cos2τ)
sin2t = 2sintcost

Convolution Theorem (*) = convolution symbol in this context
(w/ Laplace tranform)
L{f(t)} = F(s)
L{g(t)} = G(s)
L{(f * g)(t)} = F(s)G(s)
(f * g)(t) = L^-1(F(s)G(s))

example:
2s/(s^2 + 1)^2
= 2 * 1/(s^2 + 1) * s/(s^2 + 1)
= L^-1{2 * 1/(s^2 + 1) * s/(s^2 + 1)}
2 * 1/(s^2 + 1) = F(s) = f(t) = 2sint
s/(s^2 + 1) = G(s) = g(t) = cost

L^-1{F(s)G(s)}
= L^-1{F(s)} * L^-1{G(s)}
= 2sint * cost
= S_0^t 2sin(t - τ)cosτ
f * g = S_0^t f(t - τ)g(τ) dτ
= 2 S_0^t 2sin(t - τ)cosτ
= sint * cost
= 1/2 tsint

======================

Linear indedpendence/dependence

c1 or c2 nonzero => dependent
c1 + c2 both zero => independent

example with vector:
{[2, 1], [3, 2]}
c1 = [2, 1], c2 = [3, 2]
= 0[0, 0]

2c1 + 3c2 = 0
c1 + 2c2 = 0
c1 + 3/2c2 = 0 <- multiplied the first equation to 1/2
= 1/2c2 = 0 <- subtracting third from 2 equation

by substitution
c2 = 0
c1 = 0

both 0 are lineraly independent and span R^2

example:
{[2, 1], [3, 2], [1, 2]}

* setting the end vector x1, x1
* [x1, x1] = [0, 0]
* to find linear independence

c1[2, 1] + c2[3, 2] + c3[1, 2] = [0, 0]

2c1 + 3c2 + c3 = 0
c1 + 2c2 + 2c3 = 0

lets make c3 = -1 and times the second equation by 2

2c1 + 3c2 - 1 = 0
2c1 + 4c2 - 4 = 0

-c2 + 3 = 0
-c2 = -3
c2 = 3

c2 = 3 c3 = -1
c1 + 6 - 2 = 0
c1 + 4 = 0
c1 = -4
c1 = -4 <- by plugging c2 and c3 into original equation

-4[2, 1] + 3[3, 2] - 1[1, 2] = [0, 0]

Making this lineraly dependent
c1, c2, c3 are all non-zeros

Bases - Minimum set of vectors that spans the subspace

Any set of vectors that contains the zero vector is dependent
(this of course is different then setting a vector equal to 0 and finding independence).

Vectors that define the subspace are not the subspace. The span of those vectors is the subspace.

======================

Finding a length of a vector is trivial
(in this section think of all a,b,x,y are vectors (arrow on top))
||a|| = sqrt(a ⋅ a)

find the dot product with itself

Cauchy Schwarz inequality
x, y (non-zero)

||y|| ||x|| >= |x ⋅ y|

|x ⋅ y|
= |cy ⋅ y|
= |c| |y ⋅ y|
= |c| ||y||^2
= |c| ||y|| ||y||
= ||cy|| ||y||
= ||x|| ||y||

dot product
||x + y||^2 = (x + y)⋅(x + y)

review
Law of cosines
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcostheta

finding angle between vectors
||a - b||^2 = ||b||^2 + ||a||^2 - 2||a||||b||costheta

(a - b)⋅(a - b)
= a⋅a - a⋅b - b⋅a + b⋅b
= ||a||^2 - 2(a⋅b) + ||b||^2
= ||b||^2 + ||a||^2 - 2||a||||b||costheta
canceling out terms from last two lines (angle "between")
= (a - b)⋅(a - b) = ||a||||b||costheta

special case if 2 vectors are colinear
a = cb, a is equal to a scalar to b
(c > 0) => theta is 0 (vectors are sitting on top of each other)
(c < 0) => theta is 180

a, b are perpendicular angle is going to be 90 and cos90 = 0
so a⋅b = 0 AND a,b non-zero

a⋅b = 0 is orthoganal
zero vector is orthogonal to everything

Taking the cross product between vectors gives the orthogonal vector
to prove this take the cross product with the dot product and everything will cancel out.

review:
a⋅b = ||a||||b||costheta

to get the relationship of sin
||a x b|| = ||a||||b||sintheta

Proof:
||a x b||^2 + ||a|||b||^2cos^2theta
= ||b||^2||a||^2 - ||a||^2||b||^2cos^2theta

* move ||a|||b||^2cos^2theta to the other side
* factor out ||a||^2||b||^2

= ||a x b||^2 = ||a||^2||b||^2(1 - cos^2theta)

* 1 - cos^2theta = sin^2theta

= ||a x b||^2 = ||a||^2||b||^2(sin^2theta)

* sqrt both sides:

= ||a x b|| = ||a||||b||sintheta

review
sintheta = opp/||a||
||a||sintheta = opposite

if sintheta = 1 (90) its the highest value
it becomes perpendicular
||a x b|| = ||a||||b||

If I have two vectors on a plane and connect the two vectors by themselves to make another paralellagram to get the area
Area = ||b||⋅height
Area = ||b||||a||sintheta = ||a x b||
height = ||a||sintheta
sintheta = height/||a||

triple product expansion
a x (b x c) = b(a ⋅ c) - c(a ⋅ b)

The normal vector:
Ax + By + Cz = D
n = Ai + Bj + Ck

to find the shortest distance to a point:
a point in space
f = (x0 - xp)i + (y0 - yp)j + (z0 - zp)k

(n ⋅ f)/|n| = d (shortest distance)

n ⋅ f = Ax0 - Axp + By0 - Byp + Cz0 - Zzp
|n| = sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)
-D = Axp - Byp - Czp

all together (with simplifaction)
(Ax0 + By0 + Cz0 - D) / sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) = d

example:

a random plane
1x - 2y + 3z = 5

a random point
(2, 3, 1)

1*2 - 2*3 + 3*1 - 5/sqrt(1 + 4 + 9)
= -6/sqrt(14)

Distance between planes

example
If the distance between the plane Ax - 2y + z = d

and the place containing the lines:
x-1/2 = y-2/3 = z-3/4
and
x-2/3 = y-3/4 = z-4/5 is sqrt(6)
then |d| is?

lets pick points where the first line is all zeros then one:
(1,2,3) and (3,5,7)
and a third point using second equation
(2,3,4)

a = 2i + 3j + 4k <- second minus the first point
b = i + j + k <- third point minus first point

take the determinate (cross product) of a x b 
-i + 2j - k = n

n ⋅ ((x-3)i + (y-5)j + (z-7)k) = 0
= 3 - x + 2y - 10 + 7 - z = 0
= -x + 2y - z = 0 - 3 + 10 - 7
= -x + 2y - z = 0
these are parallel planes because both 
Ax - 2y + z = d
-x + 2y - z = 0
have the same ratio

so the distance |d| is (using the first point)
(1 - 4 + 3 - d)/sqrt(1 + 4 + 1)
= -d/sqrt(6)
distance is sqrt(6)
sqrt(6) = -d/sqrt(6)
multiply both sides by sqrt(6)
6 = -d or d = -6 so
|d| = |6|

if we want the distance between the planes
(1 - 4 + 3 - (-6))/sqrt(1 + 4 + 1)
= 6/sqrt(6)
multiply 
sqrt(6)/sqrt(6)
= sqrt(6)

Null space and column space

null space of a is reduce row eschelon form
N(A) = N(rref(A))

Making the first row the pivot row
1) 2 times row one minus row 2
2) 3rd row minus 3 times the first row
A now is
A = [
	1 1 1 1
	0 1 -2 -1
	0 1 -2 -1
]

now we target:
row one, second column
row three, second column
keep row two the same

1) first row minus second row
2) subtract the second row from third
A = [
	1 0 3 2
	0 1 -2 -1
	0 0 0 0
]

* A pivot entry is a 1 to the right from the 1 above
* such as row1col1 and row2col2 from above
* columns without a pivot entry is considered "free"
* such as row3col3 and row3col4

A = [

0x_1 + x_2 - 2x_3 - x_4 = 0
			 x_3"free" x_4"free"

x_1 = -3x_3 - 2x_4
x_2 = 2x_3 + x_4

x_4 [

	1
]

N(A) more than 0 => Linear Dependent (not a basis for C(A))
since col1 and col2 of A are not free they are a basis for C(A)

basis means two things it spans V, and its L.I.

A = {a_1, a_2, .... a_n} basis for V
Dimension (Dim(V))
= # of elements of any basis of V

Vector spaces is the "dimension" of a vector space V is LITERALLY the number of vectors that make up a basis of V.

You can always express the vectors of the non pivot columns as linear combinations of the associated pivot columns, meaning we can set the free vectors to any values, usually we set them to 0 or -1 and solve so they become unnessary because the span of any column space.

PreImage

A preimage is almost the reverse, we go from an image of our co-domain, and what subset from our domain maps in our co-domain:
T^-1(s)

to find a preimage of a subset of values you want to take those values in a subset (i.e. [0 0], [1 2] etc)  with the domain of T (i.e. [1 3 2 6] 2x2 shown as a row here to save space with [x1 x2]) then take the row echeloen form of the preimage with the domain and calculate the x's that satify T.

{x memberof R^2 | T(x) = {0}}
same as the null space of A
T = Ax, ker(T) = N(A)

some review (mappings)

addition
(S + T)(x) = S(x) + T(x)
S + T: R^n -> R^m
T(x) = Bx (mxn matrix)
S(x) = Ax (mxn matrix)
= (A + B)x

scalar
(cT)(x)
= c(T(x))
= C(Bx)
= (cB)x

To apply a transformation to an xy
use the Identy matrix along with a transformation matrix

example
point = [
	-3
	2
]
flip on the why axis and stretch in the y dir
transformation = [
	-x
	2y
]
identity matrix = [
	1 0
	0 1
]
(diagonal matrix)
transformation w/ identity = [
	-1 0
	0 2
]
apply transformation w/ point = [
	3
	4
]
similiarly through rotation
find the proper sin/cos functions to where you want to map the new point to through trig angles
point1 = [
	costheta
	sintheta
]
point2 = [
	-sintheta
	costheta
]
tranform matrix
(-sin because we are rotating counter clockwise)
Rot(x) = [
	costheta -sintheta
	sintheta costheta
]
pick an angle you want and apply with the above
Rot_45(x) = [
	sqrt(2)/2 -sqrt(2)/2
	sqrt(2)/2 sqrt(2)/2
]
then multiply it by our position vectors


unit vector is always 1 but how can we go
in the same direction of another vector?
u = 1/||v|| * ||v||
u is unit vector
v is some vector in space

v = [
	1
	2
	-1
]
v = sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + -1^2)
= sqrt(6)

u = 1/sqrt(6)*[
	1
	2
	-1
]

= [
	1/sqrt(6)
	2/sqrt(6)
	-1/sqrt(6)
]

= 1

======================

Projections "shadows"
some vector in L where x - Proj_L(x) is orthogonal to L
Proj_L(x)

if vector v is on L
L = {cv | c memberof R}

cv - projection
= (x - cv)⋅v
= x⋅v - cv⋅v = 0
= x⋅v = cv⋅v
c = x⋅v/v⋅v

L = {c[2 1] | C memberof R}
x = [
	2
	3
]
Proj_L(x) =
(([
	2
	3
]⋅[
	2
	1
] / [
	2
	1
]⋅[
	2
	1
])
[

)

Matrix composition (review)
S(T(x))
= A(Bx)
= AB x

of course they need to have the same column to row (
n and m)
mxn mxn
  ^ ^

(matrix product)
is not communitive but not associative
AB != BA
in the case of 3 matrixies
AB(C) = (AB)C

Inverse
f is invertible iff there exists a function f^-1: Y->X
I = identity function

f^-1 ∘ f = I_x
AND
f ∘ f^-1 = I_y

f^-1(f(a)) = a
only has one inverse making it unique
only maps to one value making it invertable

S(f(a)) the unique solution to the equation f(x) = f(a)
S(f(a)) = a
(S ∘ f)(a) = a

f is invertible S = f^-1
S ∘ f = I_x
f ∘ S = I_y

surjective "onto"
if EVERYTHING in your range maps onto a value

injective function one-to-one
for any y memberof Y => at MOST 1 x such that f(x) = y

f: X->Y
is invertible if and only if f is both surjective and injective

if we have a co-domain of R^3 (3D space) and we have a rank2 (2 pivot points after taking the reduced row echelon form) it does not match the "onto" clause so it is not invertible.

T(x) = Ax T:R^n -> R^n
rref(A) = I_n => T is invertible

Any solution to the inhomogenious system Ax = b will take the form x_p + x_h

Is x_p + x_h a solution to Ax = b
A(x_p + x_h) = Ax_p + Ax_h
= b + 0
= b, yes it is a solution

Any solution x to Ax = b take the form x = x_p + x_h x is any solution to Ax = b
A(x - x_p) = Ax - Ax_p = 0
(x - x_p) is a solution to Ax = 0
(x - x_p) is a member of N(A)
(x - x_p) = x_h <- a homogeueous solution
x = x_h + x_p

identity transformation
T^-1 ∘ T = I_R^n

(T^-1 ∘ T)(a + b) = a + b
= (T^-1 ∘ T)(a) + (T^-1 ∘ T)(b)

T(T^-1(a + b)) = T(T^-1(a)) + T(T^-1(b))
= T(T^-1(a) + T^-1(b))

T Linear Transformation and T is invertible, then T^-1 is also a linear transformation => T^-1(x) = A^-1x

(T^-1 ∘ T)(x) = A^-1Ax
= I_Rn(x)
= I_n x

A^-1A = I_n
or
AA^-1 = I_n

Deriving row echeloen form by a transform

A = [
	1 -1 -1
	-1 2 3

T = [
 	a1
 	a2 + a1
 	a3 - a1

S = [

Making T(x) = Ax
invertible

[A | I] -> -> -> [I | A^-1]

To find the invertible:
(only if det(A) is not 0)
[
	a b
	c d
]
A^-1 = 1/det(A)
= [
	d -b
	-c a
]

example
B = [
	1 2
	3 4
]
|B| = det(B) = 1*4 - 3*2 = 4 - 6 = -2
B^-1 
= 1/-2 [
	4 -2
	-3 1
]
= [
	-2 1
	3/2 -1/2
]

To find a determinate of an nxn matrix of any size you keep breaking it up into smaller matrix of determinates (recursive) until you get to a 2x2 matrix then perform the calculations.

If your taking the determint of any row/col make sure your getting the right sign
the signs are setup like a checkerboad:
+ - + - +
- + - + -
+ - + - +
- + - + -
You would get the same end value so it would be best to pick a row that has the most 0's to easily calculate.

The rule of Sarrus is a faster way to calculate the determinate using diagonals of the matrix

using a scalar in a single row (k) when finding the determinant
det(A) = kdet(A)
if we scale the whole matrix
det(KA) = K^n det(A)

duplicate rows determinate is 0

matrix invertible iff rref is I_n

duplicate rows never get rref to be In
not invertible if det = 0

Upper trianglar determinate
is the product of the values on the main diagonal if everything below are 0's (shaped like a triangle)

if you swap rows you have to make it into a negative

Area of pallelogram = det(A)

======================

review
transpose of a matrix
A^T all the rows in A are now columns in A^T
mxn -> nxm

det(A) = det(A^T)

The product of two or more matrixies transpose is the same as the reverse product of each of the maxtrixies
(AB)^T = B^TA^T
(XYZ)^T = Z^TY^TZ^T

transpose the identity matrix is equal to the identity matrix
(AA^-1)^T = I_n^T = I_n
(A^-1A)^T = I_n^T = I_n
(A^-1)^TA^T = I_n
A^T(A^-1)^T = I_n
= (A^-1)^T is the inverse of A^T
(A^T)^-1 = (A^-1)^T

with a "free" column (not the pivot) and your solving the x's set themselves to 1
example
first augment with rr echeloen form
A = [
	2 -1 -3 | 0
	-4 2 6 | 0
]
= [
	1 -1/2 -3/2 | 0
	-1 1/2 3/2 | 0
]
= [
	1 -1/2 -3/2 | 0
	0 0 0 | 0
]
first column is pivot
= [
	0
	0
]
x1 - 1/2x2 - 3/2x3 = 0
x1 = 1/2x2 + 3/2x3
[
	x1
	x2
	x3
]
x2 = [
	1/2
	1
	0
]
x3 = [
	3/2
	0
	1
]
N(A) = span([
	1/2
	1
	0
], [
	3/2
	0
	1
])
C(A) = span([
	2
	-4
], [
	-1
	2
], [
	-3,6
]) = span([
	2
	-4
])
Rank(A) = 1

Left Nullspace!
now finding the transpose of null space
it would be the same operations, and the pivot would have 3 elements
C(A^T) = span([
	2
	-1
	-3
])

Left Nullspace of A
N(A^T) = {x | A^Tx = 0}
= {x | x^TA = 0^T}

rank linear independent
Rank(A) = Rank(A^T)

when you use span (span([])) make sure whether you are taking the column of the dependent column of the nullspace (N(A)) or the pivot of the original matrix (C(A))

rowspace
C(A^T)

any member of our rowspace C(A^T) is orthonagnal to any member of our nullspace (N(A) left nullspace of A^T)
N(A) = (C(A^T))⊥
and left nullspace is orthangonal compliment of colspace
A = B^T
N(B^T) = (C((B^T)^T)⊥
N(B^T) = C(B)⊥

pivot rows in rref(A) are a basis for the rowspace of A or C(A^T)

Rank(A) = dim(C(A)) = # of vectors in the basis for C(A)

Rank(A) = number of pivot entries in rref(A)

Rank(A) = Rank(A^T)

if v memberof N(A^TA) then v memberof N(A)

(A^TA)x = 0 => cols of A^TA are L.I. and squared
= rref(A^TA) = I_k
then A^TA is invertible

======================

dim(V⊥) = dim(N(A^T))

v subspace of R^n
Rank(A) + Nullity(A^T) = n
dim(C(A)) + dim(N(A^T)) = n
dim(v) + dim(v⊥) = n

remember dim is the number of linear independent vectors needed to have a basis for V

The only vector that is a member of a subspace and its orthogonal compliment is the 0 vector

whats the orothogonal compliment of the orthogonal compliment?
(V⊥)⊥
x memberof (V⊥)⊥ => x member of V
v memberof V => v member of (V⊥)⊥

only overlaps at 0

reminder on nullspaces
C(A^T)⊥ = N(A)
C(A)⊥ = N(A^T) <- left nullspace
N(A)⊥ = (C(A^T)⊥)⊥ = C(A^T)
N(A^T)⊥ = (C(A)⊥)⊥ = C(A)

Proj_v x = some unique vector in V such that x - Proj_v x is orthogonal to every member of V

projection onto a subspace

Performing the A^TA^-1 * A^T first then A
2x2 and the 2x4 matrix should have a 2x4
[
	2 -1 0 1
	-1 2 0 1
]
lets use this and dot it with A (above) A is a 4x2 and A^TA^-1 * A^T is 2x4 so we should have a 4x4 matrix

	2 -1 0 1
	-1 2 0 1

^ Transformation matrix for the projection

you can also find the projection via
Proj_v(x) = A^TA^-1*A^T = B
Proj_v⊥(x) = Cx
I_x = Bx + Cx
B = I_x - C
we can find C now which might be easier than to solve for B

inverse of a 1x1 matrix is trivial
[3]^-1 = [1/3]

the closest projection in a subspace is x
||x - v|| >= ||x - Proj_v(x)


if vector v is not in C(A) we can find the closest vector x*-> (vector x star) where Ax* is as close to b as possible
x* <- is least squares

minimize ||b - Ax*|| 
Ax* = Proj_C(A)b
^ this could be a lot of work maybe there is an easier way:
A^TAx* = A^Tb

example
we have the points:
(-1, 0)

y = mx + b
f(-1) = -m + b = 0
f(0) = + b = 1
f(1) = m + b = 2

rewritting our equation (x* -> m*,b*)
[

multiplied the second equation by -1 on both sides, times 2 the first equation for the third
6m* + 2b* = 4
-2m* - 4b* = -4
12m* + 4b* = 8
= 10m* = 4
m* = 4/10 = 2/5
6(2/5) + 2b* = 4
12/5 + 2b* = 4
2b* = 20/5 - 12/5 = 8/5
b* = 4/5

Change of basis matrix

Another way to write the above
C = [

A more compact way
C[a->]_B = a->

lets got the other way

we have the [d->]_B unknown

Invertible change of basis matrix
C[a->]_B = a->
Assume:
C is invertible
C is square
becomes

======================

eigen vector is just a scaled up by a transformation
eigen value is the associate value with the eigen vector (how much we scale)

(0 here is the zero vector)
0 = λv - Av
λI_nv - Av = 0
(λI_n - A)v = 0
v memberof N(λI_n - A)

D's cols are L.I. iff N(D) = {0}
λI_n - A must have L.D. cols => not invertible => determinate = 0
Av = λv for nonzero v iff deteminate(λI_n - A) = 0

example
λ is eigenvalue of A
A = [
	1 2
	4 3
]
det(
	λ[
		1 0
		0 1
	] - [
		1 2
		4 3
	]
) = 0
det([
		λ 0
		0 λ
	] - [
		1 2
		4 3
	]
)
det([
	λ-1 -2
	-4 λ-3
])
= (λ - 1)(λ - 3) - 8 = 0
= λ^2 - 3λ - λ + 3 - 8 = 0
= λ^2 4λ - 5 = 0

* λ^2 4λ - 5 
* is the characteristic poloynomoial

= (λ - 5)(λ + 1) = 0
λ = 5 or λ = -1
these are our eigenvalues now lets use this to get the eigenvector w/ an eigenspace

first 5 times our Identity

λ = 5
E_5 = N([
	5 0
	0 5
] - [
	1 2
	4 3
])
= N([
	4 -2
	-4 2
])
null space of a vector is the null space of the reduced echoleon form
[
	4 -2
	-4 2
]v = 0
becomes
[
	4 -2
	0 0
]
becomes
[
	1 -1/2
	0 0
][
	v1
	v2
] = [
	0
	0
]
v1 pivot column
v1 - 1/2v2 = 0
v1 = 1/2v2

E_5 = {[
	v1
	v2
] = t[
	1/2
	1
]}
E_5 = span([
	1/2
	1
])

now when λ = -1
E_-1 = N([
	-1 0
	0 -1
] - [
	1 2
	4 3
])
= N([
	-2 -2
	-4 -4
])
becomes
[
	-2 -2
	0 0
]
becomes
E_-1 = N([
	1 1
	0 0

])
[
	1 1
	0 0

] [
	v1
	v2
] = [
	0
	0
]
v1 + v2 = 0
v1 = -v2
v2 = t
v1 = -t

E_01 = {[
	v1
	v2
] = t[
	-1
	1
]}
= span([
	-1
	1
])

======================

Poisson Distribution
Calculate probably over a mean and time

example a small business receives, on average, 12 customers per day. What is the probability that the business will recieve exactly 8 customers in one day?
m = 12
X random variable
x = 8

P(X = x) = (m^x)(e^-m)/x!
= P(X = 8) = (12^8)(e^-12)/8!
= 0.065513
= 6.55%
