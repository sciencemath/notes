A lot of this is review, taking notes and
remembering some things along the way will become a longer lasting memory.

Some fundamentals that I keep forgetting:
derivative of arctan(x): (1/(1 + x^2))
arcsin(x) is only defined for -1 <= x <= 1
2sin(t)cos(t) = sin(2t) (identity)
cos^2(t) - sin^2(t) = cos(2t)

--------------------------------------------

A quadric surface is a surface in three-dimensional space, equation is a second degree polynomial in the variables x, y and z

Most general quadric surface has the form:
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Exy + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0
where A,B,...J are all constants

The simplest quadric surface is a sphere. A sphere of radius r > 0 centered at O has the equation
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2

the equation
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4
represents the radius r = sqrt(4) = 2 centered at (0,0,0)

The equation of a sphere of radius r > 0 centered at (x0,y0,z0) is given by
(x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2 + (z - z0)^2 = r^2

example whats the radius r and the coordinates of the center C for the sphere
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8z = 20

By completing the square for the variable z
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8z = 16
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 8z + 16) = 20 + 16
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + (z + 4)^2 = 36

we can write our equation as
(x - (-1))^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z - (-4))^2 = 6^2
center at the point C(-1, 0, -4), radius r = 6

example:
find radius r and center C for the sphere
x^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 2
rewrite the above as
x^2 + (y - (-3))^2 + (z - 1)^2 = (sqrt(2))^2
C(0,-3,1), r = sqrt(2)

example:
what is the radius of the sphere x^2 + y^2 + 6y + (z - 1)^2 = 16
by completing the square for variable y
x^2 + y^2 + 6y + (z - 1)^2 = 16
x^2 + (y^2 + 6y + 9) + (z - 1)^2 = 16 + 9
x^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 25
we can rewrite as
x^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 5^2
radius = 5

An ellipsoid is a quadric surface similar to a sphere but may be stretched or compressed in one or more directions.

The ellipsoid centered at (x0,y0,z0) is given by
(x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2 + (z - z0)^2/c^2 = 1
where a, b, and c are the semi-axes of the ellipsoid parallel to the x,y, and z axes

When a = b = c we get a sphere, a sphere is a special case of an ellipsoid.
For example, the ellipsoid centered at O with the equation
x^2 + y^2/4 + z^2 = 1

We can find the intercepts of this ellipsoid with teh x, y, and z-axes as follows
To find the x-intercepts, we set y = z = 0
x^2 + 0^2/4 + 0^2 = 1  =>  x = +/-1
x intercepts of the ellipsoid are (+/-1,0,0)
To find the y-intercepts we set x = z = 0
0^2 + y^2/4 + 0^2 = 1  =>  y = +/-2
y intercepts of the ellipsoid are (0,+/-2,0)
To find the z-intercepts, we set x = y = 0
0^2 + 0^2/4 + z^2 = 1  =>  z = +/-1
z intercepts of the ellipsoid are (0,0,+/-1)

Calculating intercepts of spheres and ellipsoids
example:
the ellipsoid (x - 2)^2/2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2/2 = 1
find x-axis intercepts
plug y = 0 and z = 0
(x - 2)^2/2 + (0)^2 + (0 + 1)^2/2 = 1
(x - 2)^2/2 + 1/2 = 1
(x - 2)^2/2 = 1/2
x - 2 = +/-1
x = 2 +/-1
x = 1, 3

Calculating intercepts of spheres and ellipsoids
example:
(x - 2)^2/12 + (y + 1)^2/6 + (z - 1)^2/2 = 1
find its intercepts with the x-axis
(x - 2)^2/12 + 1/6 + 1/2 = 1
(x - 2)^2/12 = 1/3
(x - 2)^2 = 4
x - 2 = +/-2
x = 2 +/-2
x = 0, and 4
intercepts with the x-axis are (0,0,0) and (4,0,0)

Calculating intercepts of spheres and ellipsoids
example:
(x + 1)^2/9 + (y + 2)^2 + (z - 2)^2/9 = 1
find the intercepts with the y-axis
1/9 + (y + 2)^2 + 4/9 = 1
(y + 2)^2 = 4/9
(y + 2) = +/-2/3
y = -2 +/-2/3
y = -4/3, and -8/3

The domain of a sphere or ellipsoid
given the ellipsoid x^2/4 + y^2/9 + z^2 = 1
find the domain of z = z(x,y)
we make z the subject
z^2 = 1 - x^2/4 - y^2/9
z = sqrt(1 - x^2/4 - y^2/9)
since the square root is defined only for non-negative arguments
1 - x^2/4 - y^2/9 >= 0
x^2/4 + y^2/9 <= 1
interior of the ellipse x^2/4 + y^2/9 = 1 and boundary
the domain of z = z(x,y)
{(x,y) : x^2/4 + y^2/9 <= 1}

example:
given the sphere x^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 2, what is the domain of z = z(x,y)
(z - 1) = sqrt(2 - (x^2 + (y + 3)^2)
z = 1 +/-sqrt(2 - (x^2 + (y + 3)^2)
since the square root is defined only for non-negative arguments
2 - (x^2 + (y + 3)^2 >= 0
x^2 + (y + 3)^2 <= 2
inequality describes the interior and boundary of the circle
x^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 2
which is a circle of radius sqrt(2) centered at (0,-3) in the xy-plane.

example:
given the ellipsoid:
(x - 1)^2/16 + y^2/4 + (z + 2)^2 = 1
find the domain of z = z(x,y)
z + 2 = sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2/16 - y^2/4)
1 - (x - 1)^2/16 - y^2/4 >= 0
(x - 1)^2/16 + y^2/4 <= 1
interior of the ellipse (x - 1)^2/16 + y^2/4 = 1 and its boundary
domain:
{(x,y) : (x - 1)^2/16 + y^2/4 <= 1}

The trace of a surface is the collection of points where the surface intersects a plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes
x^2 + y^2/4 + z^2 = 1
the trace of this surface in the zy-plane (when z = 0):
x^2 + y^2/4 + (0)^2 = 1
which is an ellipse centered at (0,0) in the xy-plane with semi-axes 1 and 2
the trace in the xz-plane (when y = 0):
x^2 + (0)^2/4 + z^2 = 1
x^2 + z^2 = 1
ellipse centered at (0,0) in the xz plane with radius 1
the trace in the yz (when x = 0):
(0)^2 + y^2/4 + z^2 = 1 which is an ellipse centered at (0,0 in the yz plane) with semi-axes 2 and 1
traces are not always ellipses (trace is an empty set) or if they intersect at a single point.

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4
is a sphere, lets find its intersection with the plane z = 1 and the projection of the intersection onto the xy-plane.

To find the intersection we substitute z = 1 into the equation of the sphere
x^2 + y^2 + (1)^2 = 4
x^2 + y^2 = 3
x^2 + y^2 = sqrt(3)^2
This gives the circle of radius sqrt(3) centered at (0,0,1) in the plane z = 1

example:
find trace in xy-plane, substitute z = 0 into the equation of the sphere:
x^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (0 - 3)^2 = 25
x^2 + (y + 2)^2 + 9 = 25
x^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 16
radius 4 centered at (0,-2)

example:
What is the trace in the xz-plane of the sphere:
(x - 2)^2 + y^2 + (z + 2)^2 = 16
(x - 2)^2 + (0)^2 + (z + 2)^2 = 16
(x - 2)^2 + (z + 2)^2 = 16

example:
What is the trace in the xz-plane of the ellipsoid:
x^2/25 + y^2/16 + (z + 1)^2/4 = 1
x^2/25 + (z + 1)^2/4 = 1
x^2/5^2 + (z + 1)^2/2^2 = 1
Ellipse with semi axis 5 and 2 centered at (0,-1) in the xz-plane

example:
what is the projection of the intersection between the sphere (x + 2)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 and the plane z = 1 onto the xy-plane
(x + 2)^2 + y^2 + (1)^2 = 9
(x + 2)^2 + y^2 + 1 = 9
(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 8
(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = (2sqrt(2))^2
radius 2sqrt(2) centered at (-2,0)

===================================================

A hyperboloid of one sheet centered at (x0,y0,z0) is a quadric surface
(x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2 - (z - z0)^2/c^2 = 1

A hyperboloid of two sheets centered at (x0,y0,z0)
(x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2 - (z - z0)^2/c^2 = -1
(similar to the one above but -1 not +1)

Indentifying the intercepts 
example:
hyperboloid of one sheet
(x - 3)^2/9 + (y + 4)^2/16 - (z - 5)^2/25 = 1
find its intercepts with the x-axis
to find the x-intercepts plug in y = 0, z = 0
(x - 3)^2/9 + (0 + 4)^2/16 - (0 - 5)^2/25 = 1
(x - 3)^2/9 + 1 - 1 = 1
(x - 3)^2/9 = 1
(x - 3)^2 = 9
x - 3 = +/-sqrt(9)
x = 3 +/-3
x = 0,6
intercepts the x-axis are (0,0,0) and (6,0,0)

example:
given the hyperboloid of two sheets x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1 find its x-intercepts
x^2 = -1
this equation has no real solutions

example:
given the hyperboloid of two sheets x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1 find its z-intercepts
-z^2 = -1
z^2 = 1
z = +/-1
intercepts with the z-axis are (0,0,-1) and (0,0,1)

example:
given the hyperboloid of one sheet:
(x - 2)^2/4 + y^2/16 - z^2/5 = 1
find its x-intercepts
(x - 2)^2/4 = 1
(x - 2) = +/-sqrt(4)
x = 2 +/-2
intercepts the x-axis are (4,0,0) and (0,0,0)

Indentifying the domain of a hyperboloid
hyperboloid of two sheets:
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 - z^2/4 = -1
find the domain of z = z(x,y)
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2/4
z^2/4 = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1
z^2 = 4((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1)
z = +/-2sqrt((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1)
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1 >= 0
the domain of z(x,y) is R^2
(non-negative)

example:
hyperboloid of two sheets:
x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1
find the domain z = z(x,y)
x^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2
z^2 = 1 + x^2 + y^2
z^2 = +/-sqrt(1 + x^2 + y^2)
1 + x^2 + y^2 >= 1
domain of z(x,y) is R^2

example:
hyperboloid of one sheet:
(x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 - z^2/9 = 1
find the domain of z(x,y)
(x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 + 1 = z^2/9
z^2 = 9((x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 - 1)
z = +/-3sqrt((x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 - 1)
(non-negative)
(x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 - 1 >= 0
(x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 >= 1
gives the exterior of the ellipse (x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 = 1 includes the boundary
domain is
{(x,y) : (x - 2)^2 + y^2/4 >= 1}

Alternative Orientations of the Axis of Symmetry
the hyperboloids we've seen thus far have axes of symmetry are parallel to the z-azis. Now lets see hyperboloid is oriented along the x or y-axes

A hyperboloid of one sheet centered at the origin.
When the y term is negative the axis of symmetry is the y-axis:
x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1
When the x term is negative, the axis of symmetry is the z-axis
-x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1

Likewise for a hyperboloid of two sheets centered at the origin
when the y term is negative the axis of symmetry is the y-axis:
x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = -1
when x term is negative axis of symmetry is the x-axis
-x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = -1

The traces of a hyperboloid of one sheet are either ellipses or hyperbolas
Lets find the traces with the coordinate planes for the hyperboloid of one sheet
x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1
the trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z = 0)
x^2 + y^2 - 0 = 1
x^2 + y^2  1
which is a circle centered at the origin of radius 1 in the xy-plane
the trace of this surface in the xz-plane (y = 0)
x^2 + 0^2 - z^2 = 1
x^2 - z^2 = 1
is a hyperbola in the xz-plane centered at the origin
the trace yz-plane (x = 0)
0^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1
y^2 - z^2 = 1
is a hyperbola in the yz-plane centered at the origin

The traces of the hyperboloid of two sheets are either ellipse, hyperbolas, single point, or the empty set.
lets find traces with the coordinate plane
x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1
the trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z = 0) is the empty set since the surface does not intersect the xy-plane
tace of xz-plane (y = 0)
x^2 - z^2 = -1
which is a hyperbola in the xz-plane centered at the origin
the trace of yz-plane (x = 0)
y^2 - z^2 = -1
which is a hyperbola in the yz-plane centered at the origin
Note:
the trace of our surface with the plane z = 1 is a single point:
x^2 + y^2 - 1^2 = -1  =>  (x,y,z) = (0,0,1)
likewise the trace of our surface with the plane z = -1 is another point:
x^2 + y^2 - (-1)^2 = -1  =>  (x,y,z) = (0,0,-1) 
The trace of our surface with the horizontal plane z = k for |k| > 1 is a circle:
x^2 + y^2 - k^2 = -1  =>  x^2 + y^2 = k^2 - 1

Finding Traces of Hyperboloids:
example:
The projection of the intersection between the hyperboloid of two sheets:
-(x - 5)^2/8 + y^2/50 + (z - 3)^2 = -1
the plane z = 4 other the xy-plane is a hyperbola. What are the lengths of the semi-axes of the hyperbola?
substitute z = 4 into the equation of the hyperboloid
-(x - 5)^2/8 + y^2/50 + 1 = -1
-(x - 5)^2/8 + y^2/50 = -2
(x - 5)^2/8 - y^2/50 = 2
(x - 5)^2/16 - y^2/100 = 1
(x - 5)^2/4^2 - y^2/10^2 = 1
this gives us the equation of the hyperbola with semi-axes of lengths 4 and 10

example:
what is the trace in the yz-plane of the hyperboloid of one sheet x^2/2 + y^2/5 - z^2/3 = 1
y^2/5 - z^2/3 = 1

example:
The projection of the intersection between the hyperboloid of one sheet:
x^2/8 + (y - 4)^2/18 - z^2/50 = 1
and the plane x = 2 onto the yz-plane is a hyperbola. What are the lengths of the semi-axes of the hyperbola
(y - 4)^2/18 - z^2/50 = 1/2
(y - 4)^2/9 - z^2/25 = 1
(y - 4)^2/3^2 - z^2/5^2 = 1
A hyperbola with semi-axes of lengths 3 and 5

===================================================

Quadric surface with the equation
z = x^2 + y^2
is an elliptic paraboloid

The vertex of this elliptic paraboloid is located at the origin and its azis of symmetry is the z-axis. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line that passes through the vertex

The equation of an elliptic paraboloid whose vertex is at the point (x0,y0,z0)
z - z0 = (x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2

The surfaces are called the elliptic paraboloids because their traces in the xy-plane are ellipses while their traces in the yz and xz-planes are parabolas.

example:
Find the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the elliptic paraboloid z = 4x^2 + 8(y + 2)^2
to find the vertex, we need to rewrite our equation:
z - 0 = 4x^2 + 8(y + 2)^2
z - 0 = x^2/(1/4) + (y + 2)^2/(1/8)
z - 0 = (x - 0)^2/(1/4) + (y - (-2))^2/(1/8)
gives us the equation of an elliptic paraboloid that has its vertex at (0,-2,0), we can conclude that its axis of symmetry is parallel to the z-axis
The axis of symmetry should pass through the vertex of the paraboloid. The equation of the axis of symmetry can be written as an intersection of two planes:
{
	x = 0
	y = -2
}

example:
Find the vertex of the elliptic paraboloid:
z - 2 = 3(x + 1)^2 + 4y^2
z - 2 = (x + 1)^2/(1/3) + y^2/(1/4)
z - 2 = (x - (-1)^2/(1/3) + y^2/(1/4))
vertex is at (-1, 0, 2)

example:
given the elliptic paraboloid:
z + 4 = x^2/4 + (y - 4)^2/4
find its intercepts with the x-axis
0 + 4 = x^2/4 + (0 - 4)^2/4
4 = x^2/4 + 16/4
4 = x^2/4 + 4
x^2/4 = 0
x = 0 the intercept with the x-axis is (0,0,0)

example:
elliptic paraboloid:
z = (x + 1)^2/2 + (y - 2)^2/4
z - 0 = (x - (-1))^2/2 + (y - 2)^2/4
vertex at (-1, 2, 0) axis is parallel to the z-axis
The axis of symmetry should pass through the vertex of the paraboloid. The axis of symmetry can be written as an intersection of two planes:
{
	x = -1
	y = 2
}

The graph of the quadric surface
z = x^2 - y^2
This surface is an example of a hyperbolic paraboloid whose saddle point is at the origin.
A hyperbolic paraboloid whose saddle point is at (x0,y0,z0) has the general equation
z - z0 = (x - x0)^2/a^2 - (y - y0)^2/b^2

These surfaces are called hyperbolic paraboloids because their traces in the xy-plane are hyperbolas while their traces in the yz- and xz-planes are parabolas.

The hyperbolic paraboloid has rotational symmetry of order 2 about the z-axis. We can refer to the z-axis as the axis of symmetry of the hyperbolic paraboloid.

example:
find the saddle point of the hyperbolic paraboloid z + 1 = (x - 1)^2/4 - (y - 2)^2
to find saddle point rewrite
z + 1 = (x - 1)^2/4 - (y - 2)^2
z - (-1) = (x - 1)^2/4 - (y - 2)^2
saddle point is at (1,2,-1)

example:
find the saddle point of the hyperbolic paraboloid z + 1 = (x + 3)^2/2 - y^2/4
z - (-1) = (x - (-3))^2/2 - (y - 0)^2/4
saddle point at (-3, 0, -1)

example:
hyperbolic paraboloid:
(x - 5)^2 - 8(y + 2)^2 = z + 4
find intercepts with the x-axis
(x - 5)^2 - 8(2)^2 = 4
(x - 5)^2 - 32 = 4
(x - 5)^2 = 36
(x - 5) = +/-6
x = 5 +/-6

We've already seen elliptic paraboloids with axes of symmetry are parallel to the z-axis, lets now consider cases when an elliptic paraboloid is oriented along the x or y-axes.

When the vertex is at the origin and the y term is linear, the axis of symmetry is the y-axis:
y = x^2/a^2 + z^2/c^2

When the vertex is at the origin and the x term is linear, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis:
x = y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2

When the saddle point is at the origin and the y term is linear, the axis of symmetry is the y-axis. The two corresponding equations are:
y = x^2/a^2 - z^2/c^2 
y = z^2/c^2 - x^2/a^2

When the saddle point is at the origin and the x term is linear, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis. The two corresponding equations are:
x = z^2/c^2 - y^2/b^2 
x = y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2

The traces of an elliptic paraboloid are either ellipses, parabolas, a single point, or the empty set
lets find traces with the coordinate planes for the hyperboloid of two sheets
z = x^2 + y^2
The trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z = 0)
x^2 + y^2 = 0
which corresponds to the origin (0,0,0)
The trace of this surface in the xz-plane (y = 0)
x^2 = z (vertex at origin)
The trace of this surface in the yz-plane (x = 0)
y^2 = z (vertex at origin)
The trace of our surface with the plane z = -k for k > 0 is the empty set, becasue z >= 0 everywhere on the elliptic paraboloid
The trace of our surface with the plane z = k for k > 0 is an ellipse:
x^2 + y^2 = k

The trace3s of a hyperbolic paraboloid are hyperbolas, parabolas, or intersecting lines.
lets find the traces with the coordinate planes of the hyperboloid of two sheets given by
z = x^2 - y^2
The trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z = 0):
x^2 - y^2 = 0
y^2 = x^2
y = +/-x
which corresponds to two intersecting lines in the xy-plane
The trace of this surface in the xz-plane (y = 0):
x^2 - 0^2 = z
z = x^2
corresponds to the parabola in the xz-pane that has its vertex at the origin.
The trace of this surface in the yz-plane (x = 0)
0^2 - y^2 = z
z = -y^2
corresponds to the parabola in the yz-plane vertex is at origin.
In this case the saddle point is at the origin, min point for the trace xz-plane but max point for the trace in the yz-plane

The projection of the intersection between the hyperbolic paraboloid
x^2/4 - (y + 5)^2/3 = z - 1
and the plane x = 2 onto the yz-plane is a parabola, find the vertex of the parabola.
substitute:
2^2/4 - (y + 5)^2/3 = z - 1
1 - (y + 5)^2/3 = z - 1
z = -1/3(y + 5)^2 + 2
projecting this onto the yz-plane, vertex at (-5,2)

example:
What is the trace in the yz-plane of the hyperbolic paraboloid:
z - 3 = (x - 5)^2/5 - y^2/4
z - 3 = (0 - 5)^2/5 - y^2/4
z - 3 = 25/5 - y^2/4
z - 3 = 5 - y^2/4
z - 8 = -y^2/4
y^2 = -4(z - 8)

example:
The projection of the intersection between the elliptic paraboloid:
4(x - 1)^2 + 25(y + 1)^2 = 100(z - 2) and the plane z = 7 onto the xy-plane is an ellipse, what are the lengths of the semi-axes of the ellipse?
4(x - 1)^2 + 25(y + 1)^2 = 500
(x - 1)^2/125 + (y + 1)^2/20 = 1
(x - 1)^2/(5sqrt(5))^2 + (y + 1)^2/(2sqrt(5))^2 = 1
semi-axes of lengths 5sqrt(5) and 2sqrt(5)

quadric surface
z^2 = x^2 + y^2
Elliptic cone, vertex at origin and z-axis is the axis of symmetry of the cone
The equation of an elliptic cone vertex (x0,y0,z0)
(z - z0)^2 = (x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2

example:
elliptic cone
(x - 2)^2/4 + (y - 2)^2/2 = (z + 1)^2/3
find its intercepts with the z-axis
we plug in x = 0 and y = 0 into the equation and solve for z:
((0) - 2)^2/4 + ((0) - 2)^2/2 = (z + 1)^2/3
4/4 + 4/2 = (z + 1)^2/3
1 + 2 = (z + 1)^2/3
3 = (z + 1)^2/3
9 = (z + 1)^2
z + 1 = +/-3
z = -1 +/-3
z = -4,2
z-axis intercepts (0,0,-4) and (0,0,2)

example:
elliptic cone:
(x - 2)^2/2 + (y + 2)^2/4 = (z + 3)^2
find its intercepts with the x-axis
(x - 2)^2/2 + (0 + 2)^2/4 = (0 + 3)^2
(x - 2)^2 = 16
(x - 2) = +/-4
x = 2+/-4
x = -2,6

example:
find the center of the elliptic cone:
2(x + 2)^2 + 3(y - 1)^2 = z^2
(-2,1,0)

The traces of an elliptic conse are either intersecting lines, ellipses, hyperbolas, or points.
The traces with the coordinate planes for the elliptic cone
z^2 = x^2 + y^2
The trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z = 0) is given by the equation
x^2 + y^2 = 0, origin (0,0,0)
trace of this surface in the xz-plane (y = 0)
x^2 + 0^2 = z^2
x^2 = z^2
x = +/-z
corresponds to two lines in the xz-plane
the trace of this surface in the yz-plane (x = 0)
y^2 = z^2
y = +/-z
corresponds to two lines in the yz-plane
trace of our surface with the plane z = k for k != 0 is an ellipse
x^2 + y^2 = k^2
the traces of our surface with the plane x = k or y = k for k != 0 are hyperbolas:
z^2 - y^2 = k^2 or z^2 - x^2 = k^2

Lets consider the cases when a cone is oriented along the x or y-axes, for an elliptic cone centered at the origin, the other two cases are
When the y^2 term is isolated on one side, the axis of symmetry is the y-axis
y^2 = x^2/a^2 + z^2/c^2
When the x^2 term is isolated on one side, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis
x^2 = y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2

finding traces of elliptic cones
What is the trace in the xz-plane of the elliptic cone 
3x^2 + 4y^2 = 12(z + 3)^2
substitute y = 0
3x^2 = 12(z + 3)^2
x^2 = 4(z + 3)^2
+/-x = 2(z + 3)
+/-x/2 = z + 3
z = +/- x/2 - 3
this gives us two lines in the xz-plane z = +/- x/2 - 3

example:
What is the trace in the yz-plane of the elliptic cone:
x^2/8 + y^2/4 = (z - 4)^2
+/-y/2 = z - 4
z = +/-y/2 + 4
(not sure how the y/4 became a y/2, answer might be wrong, I got z = +/-y/4 + 4)

example:
the intersection of the elliptic cone 3(x + 4)^2 + 8y^2 = 12z^2 and the plane z = -2 is an ellipse, what is the length of its major axis?
3(x + 4)^2 + 8y^2 = 12(-2)^2
3(x + 4)^2 + 8y^2 = 48
(x + 4)^2/16 + y^2/6 = 1
(x + 4)^2/4^2 + y^2/(sqrt(6))^2 = 1
semi-major axis of length a = 4
major axis has length 2a = 8

===================================================

A cylinder is a surface made by the set of lines that pass through a plane curve C in the xy-plane and are perpendicular to this plane, curve C is called the base curve.

Two-dimensional conic sections (circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas) can be used to describe cylinders

An elliptic cylinder is a cylinder whose base curve C is an ellipse, if the ellipse lies in thexy-plane and is centered at (x0,y0,0), then the equation of our elliptic cylinder is
(x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2 = 1
if a = b we get a circular cylinder.

This may look like an equation of a regular ellipse, but since we're now describing a surface in three-dimensional space, we assume the z-coordinate is arbitrary. If we want z to feature in our equations explicity we would write
(x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2 = 1, z = k

The graph of an elliptic cylinder
x^2/4 + y^2 = 1
The center of the base ellipse C is at the origin, and the axis of the elliptic cylinder is the z-axis 

The trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z=0)
x^2/4 + y^2 = 1
which is the base ellipse C cnetered at the origin (0,0,0) wth semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths 2 and 1
the trace in xy-plane (y=0)
x^2/4 + 0^2 = 1
x^2 = 4
x = +/-2
corresponds to two lines in the xz-plane
trace in the yz-plane (x=0)
0^2/4 + y^2 = 1
y^2 = 1
y = +/-1
corresponds to two lines in the yz-plane

A parabolic cylinder has a base curve C that is a parabola.
If the parabola C opens upward or downward when viewed from the xy-plane and its vertex is at (x0,y0,0) then the equation of the parabolic cylinder becomes
(x - x0)^2 = 4p(y - y0)

the graph of the parabolic cylinder
x^2 = y
its base curve is an upward-opening parabola in the xy-plane with its vertex at the origin. The axis of the cylinder is the z-axis

The trace of this parabolic cylinder can be a parabola or a set of lines.
the trace of this in the xy-plane (z=0)
x^2 = y
corresponds to the base parabola C with its vertex at the origin (0,0,0)
trace in xy-plane (y=0)
x^2 = 0
x = 0
corresponds to a line in the xz-plane
trace of this surface in the yz-plane (x=0)
0^2 = y
y = 0
corresponds to a line in the yz-plane

If the base parabola C is left-opening or right-opening when viewed from the xy-plane and its vertex is at (x0,y0,0), then the equation of the parabolic cylinder is
(y - y0)^2 = 4p(x - x0)

A hyperbolic cylinder is a cylinder whose base curve C is a hyperbola

if the hyperbola C is horizontal in the xy-plane and is centered at (x0,y0,0) the equation is given by:
(x - x0)^2/a^2 - (y - y0)^2/b^2 = 1 

A graph of the hyperbola cylinder
x^2 - y^2 = 1
its base curve is a horizontal hyperbola in the xy-plane centered at the origin. The axis of the cylinder is the z-axis

The trace of this surface can be a hyperbola, a set of lines, or the empty set
the trace of this surface in the xy-plane (z=0)
x^2 - y^2 = 1
which is the base hyperbola C centered at the origin (0,0,0)
trace of xy-plane (y=0)
x^2 - 0^2 = 1
x^2 = 1
x = +/- 1
corresponds to a pair of lines in the xz-plane
trace of yz-plane (x=0) is the empty set

If the base hyperbola C is vertical when viewed from the xy-plane and is centered at (x0,y0,0) the equation of the hyperbolic cylinder:
(y - y0)^2/b^2 - (x - x0)^2/a^2 = 1 

The domain of a cylinder
What is the domain in the xy-plane of the elliptic cylinder
x^2/9 + (y + 1)^2 = 1
the domain of any cylinder in the xy-plane is its base curve
{(x,y) : x^2/9 + (y + 1)^2 = 1}
can be written as
{(x,y) : x^2/3^2 + (y + 1)^2/1^2 = 1}
This is an ellipse centered at (0,-1) with semi-axes of lengths 3 and 1

example:
What is the domain in the xy-plane of the hyperbolic cylinder
(x + 1)^2/4 - (y - 4)^2/2 = 1
This is a hyperbola centered at (-1,4)

example:
What is the domain in the xy-plane of the elliptic cylinder
(x - 1)^2/16 + (y + 2)^2/8 = 1
this domain is
{(x,y) : (x - 1)^2/16 + (y + 2)^2/8 = 1}
which can be written as
{(x,y) : (x - 1)^2/4^2 + (y + 2)^2/(2sqrt(2))^2 = 1}
this is an ellipse centered at (1,-2) with semi-axes of lengths 4 and 2sqrt(2)

We can also define cylinders whose axes are parallel to the x or y-axes. To do this, we simply need to describe a base curve in either the yz-plane or the xz-plane

For an elliptic cylinder whose base ellipse C is centered at the origin the other two cases
(sideways)
Elliptic cylinder C whose base curve lies in the xz-plane
x^2/a^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1
The axis of the elliptic cylinder is the y-axis

The elliptic cylinder C whose base curve lies in the yz-plane
y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1
the axis of the elliptic cylinder is the x-axis.

For a parabolic cylinder whose base parabola C has its vertex at the origin the other four cases:
When C is in the xz-plane and p = 1 the axis is the y-axis x^2 = z, z^2 = x
if p = -1 we get a reflection in the xy-plane or yz-plane of the parabolic cylinders.
When C is in the yz-plane and p = 1, the axis is the x-axis y^2 = z, z^2 = y

For a hyperbolic cylinder whose base hyperbola C has its vertex at the origin, the other four cases are as follows
When C is in the xz-plane, the axis of the hyperbolic cylinder is the y-axis
z^2/c^2 - x^2/a^2 = 1
x^2/a^2 - z^2/c^2 = 1
When C is in the yz-plane, the axis of the hyperbolic cylinder is the x-axis
z^2/c^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1
y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = 1

example:
what is the trace in the yz-plane of the elliptic cylinder
x^2/2 + (y - 2)^2/4 = 1
to find the trace in the yz-plane we substitute x = 0 into the equation
0^2/2 + (y - 2)^2/4 = 1
(y - 2)^2 = 4
y - 2 = +/- 2
y = 2 +/- 2
y = 0, 4
the equation of two lines y = 0 and y = 4 yz-plane

example:
what is the trace in the xz-plane of the hyperbolic cylinder:
(x - 1)^2/8 - y^2/4 = 1
(x - 1)^2/8 = 1
(x - 1)^2 = 8
x - 1 = +/-2sqrt(2)
x = 1 +/-2sqrt(2)
this gives us two lines in the xz-plane

example:
The projection of the intersection between the elliptic cylinder 9x^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 = 18 and the plane z = 1 onto the xy-plane is an ellipse. What are the lengths of the semi-axis of the ellipse?
Since the equation has no explicit z term:
9x^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 = 18
x^2/2 + (y - 1)^2/9 = 1
x^2/(sqrt(2))^2 + (y - 1)^2/3^2 = 1
an ellipse with semi-axes of lengths sqrt(2) and 3

===================================================

We can generate paraboloids, hyperboloids, and cones with alternative orientation axes by permuting the variables in the corresponding equation.
For example, the equation of an elliptic cone with its vertex at O and axis of symmetry along the y-axis is given by
y^2/b^2 = x^2/a^2 + z^2/c^2

We can shift the center/vertex/saddle point of a quadric surface to (x0,y0,z0) using the usual coordinate transformation:
(x,y,z) -> (x - x0, y - y0, z - z0)

There is a simple way to distinguish between hyperboloids with one and two sheets by simply looking at the equations
one minus sign are hyperboloids of one sheet:
x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = 1
two minus signs indicate hyperboloids of two sheets:
x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = -1

We can generate cylinders with alternative orientation axes by describing a base curve in the xz-plane or yz-planes
The equation of an elliptic cylinder with its axis of symmetry along the y-axis
x^2/a^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1
We can shift the center or vertex of the base curve the usual way.

Identify the surface:
z - 1 = (x - 3)^2/4 - (y + 2)^2/4
The equation of a hyperboloic paraboloid centered at O
z = x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2
a hyperbolic paraboloid centered at (x0,y0,z0)
z - z0 = (x - x0)^2/a^2 - (y - y0)^2/b^2
Our equation is a hyperbolic paraboloid
(x0,y0,z0) = (3,-2,1), a = b = 2

example:
identify the surface
x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1
Equation of a hyperboloid of two sheets centered at O is given by
x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = -1
a = b = c = 1

example:
identify the surface:
(z - 1)^2 = x^2 + (y - 2)^2/4
(notice all the variables are squared hint)
The equation of an elliptic cone centered at O is given by
z^2/c^2 = x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2
and an elliptic cone is centered at (x0,y0,z0)
(z - z0)^2/c^2 = (x - x0)^2/a^2 + (y - y0)^2/b^2
(x0,y0,z0) = (1,0,2), a = c = 1, b = 2

Identifying Quadric surfaces and cylinders with alternative orientations
identify the surface:
x = y^2/4 - 4z^2
the equation of the hyperbolic paraboloid centered at O whose axis of symmetry is the z-axis
z = x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2
A hyperbolic paraboloid centered at O the axis of x-axis symmetry
x = y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2
Our equation is a hyperbolic paraboloid with axis of symmetry is the x-axis, and b = 2, c = 1/2

example:
identify the surface
z^2 + y^2 - x^2 = 1
The equation of a hyperboloid of one sheet centered at O has axis of symmetry is the z-axis
x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = -1
A hyerboloid of one sheet centered at O has axis of symmetry is the x-axis is given by
-x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = -1
a = b = c = 1

example:
identify the surface
z^2 = 8x
The equation of a parabolic cylinder whose axis is the z-axis is given by
x^2 = 4py
A parabolic cylinder whose axis is the y-axis is given by
z^2 = 4px
axis is the y-axis and p = 2

identify quadric surfaces by completing the square
-x^2 + z^2 + 2x + y = 0
first we complete the square in the x term
-(x^2 - 2x) + z^2 + y = 0
-(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 + y = 0
rearrange
-(x - 1)^2 + z^2 = -y - 1
(x - 1)^2 - z^2 = y + 1
This is the equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid centered at (1,-1,0) the axis of symmetry here is the y-axis

example:
identify the surface
4x^2 + 8y^2 + 2z^2 - 8x + 8z + 4 = 0
first complete the square for x and z
4(x^2 - 2x) + 8y^2 + 2(z^2 + 4z) + 4 = 0
4[(x - 1)^2 - 1] + 8y^2 + 2[(z + 2)^2 - 4] + 4 = 0
4(x - 1)^2 - 4 + 8y^2 + 2(z + 2)^2 - 8 + 4 = 0
4(x - 1)^2 + 8y^2 + 2(z + 2)^2 - 8 = 0
rearrange:
4(x - 1)^2 + 8y^2 + 2(z + 2)^2 = 8
4(x - 1)^2/8 + 8y^2/8 + 2(z + 2)^2/8 = 1
(x - 1)^2/2 + y^2 + (z + 2)^2/4 = 1
this is the equation of an ellipsoid centered at (1,0,-2)

example:
identify the surface
2x^2 - 4z^2 - 4x - y - 16z - 12 = 0
first complete the square for x and z
2(x^2 - 2x) - 4(z^2 - 4z) - y - 12 = 0
2[(x - 1)^2 - 1] - 4[(z + 2)^2 - 4] - y - 12 = 0
2(x - 1)^2 - 2 - 4(z + 2)^2 + 16 - y - 12 = 0
2(x - 1)^2 - 4(z + 2)^2 - y + 2 = 0
rearrange:
2(x - 1)^2 - 4(z + 2)^2 = y - 2
This is the equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid centered at (1,2,-2) where the axis of symmetry is the y-axis

===================================================

A function f(x,y) of two variables is a rule that maps each pair of numbers (x,y) to a unique real number, this is the domain of f

For instance consider the following two-variable function:
f(x,y) = sin(xy)/sqrt(x - 1)
Lets evaluate f(x,y) at the point (2,pi) substitute x = 2 and y = pi into the function expression:
f(2,pi) = sin(xy)/sqrt(x - 1)
= sin(2 * pi)/sqrt(2 - 1)
= 0/1
= 0
Since f(2,pi) returned a unique real number this means that (2,pi) belongs to the domain of f.

Evaluate f(x,y) at (0,pi) substitute x = 0 and y = pi into the function expression:
f(0,pi) = sin(xy)/sqrt(x - 1)
= sin(0 * pi)/sqrt(0 - 1)
= 0/sqrt(-1)
which is undefined
since f(0,pi) did not return a unique real number the means that (0,pi) is not in the domain.

The function f(x,y) is defined as
f(x,y) = y^2 - log_3(x - 7)
evaluate at (10,3)
= 3^2 - log_3(10 - 7)
= 9 - log_3(3)
= 9 - 1
= 8

example:
evaluate
z = x^2 + xy - 5 at (1,2)
z = -2

example:
f(x,y) = cos(xy)/y+1 at the point (pi,-1)
= cos(pi * 1)/-1 + 1
= -1/0
= undefined

The domain of a multivariable function is the set of points where the function is defined.
z = f(x,y) = sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)
the function is well-defined at all points (x,y) for which the expression under the square root is non-negative, the points in the domain must satisify the inequality
1 - x^2 - y^2 >= 0  =>  x^2 + y^2 <= 1
domain is
D = {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 <= 1}

Natural domain is the largest set of values for which the function is defined

Find the domain of a function involving reciprocals and radicals
z = (sqrt(y + 1)/x + y)
the function is well defined for all points if the denominator is not zero and under the square root is non-negative
{
	y + 1 >= 0  =>  y >= -1
	x + y != 0  =>  y != -x
}
{
	(x,y) : y >= -1, y != -x
}

example:
domain of f(x,y) = xy/x^2 + y^2
{(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 != 0}

example:
domain of z = sqrt(9 - x^2 - y^2)/x + y
{(x,y) : x^2 + y^2, x + y != 0}

example:
domain of z = ln(2x + y)/sqrt(x)
the expression under the logarithm is postive
(and all other rules apply)
{(x,y) : 2x + y > 0, x > 0}

example:
domain of f(x,y) = e(^x^2 - y^2)
this is defined for the entire xy plane

example:
domain of z = ln(x + y)/y
{(x,y) : x + y > 0, y != 0}

example:
domain of f(x,y) = arccos(x - y)
{(x,y) : -1 <= x - y <= 1}
The argument of the arccosine has values between -1 and 1

===================================================

If we want to find the intersection of a surface say f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 with the plane z = 4
we need to set both equations equal to each other
x^2 + y^2 = 4, graphing this gives us a circle C center at (0,0) radius 2. C is called level curve
x^2 + y^2 = c. The level curves are sometimes called contours.

A level curve L_c(f) of a real valued function of two variables f(x,y) is any set of the form:
L_c(f) = {(x,y) : f(x,y) = c}

Find the equation of the level curve that passes through the point G(sqrt(5),1) for f(x,y) = 12y/(x^2 - y^2)
12(1)/(sqrt(5)^2 - 1^2) = 3
the level curve that passes through G(sqrt(5),1) is the 3-level curve.
12y/(x^2 - y^2) = 3
4y = x^2 - y^2
x^2 - y^2 - 4y - 4 = -4
x^2 - (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -4
x^2 - (y - 2)^2 = -4
the level curve that passes through G(sqrt(5),1) is the hyperbola x^2 - (y - 2)^2 = -4

example:
find the equation of the level curve that passes through the point P(1,2) for f(x,y) = 1/(y - x^2)
1/(2 - 1^2) = 1
P(1,2) is the 1-level curve
1 = y - x^2
1 = y - x^2
y = x^2 + 1
the level curve that passes through P(1,2) is the parabola y = x^2 + 1

example:
find the equation of the level curve that passes through the point P(0,1) for f(x,y) = 1 - 4x^2 - y^2
4x^2 + y^2 = 1
the level curve that passes through P(0,1) is the ellipse 4x^2 + y^2 = 1

Determining the shape of a level curve
f(x,y) = (x^2 + 2y^2 - 2)/x^2, f(x,y) = c
(x^2 + 2y^2 - 2)/x^2 = c
x^2 + 2y^2 - 2 = cx^2
(1 - c)x^2 + 2y^2 = 2
c = 1 level curve is y^2 = 1 (two lines)
c = 0 level curve is x^2 + 2y^2 = 2 (ellipse)
c = 2 level curve is 2y^2 - x^2 = 2 (hyperbola)

example:
level curves of f(x,y) = x^3y - y^2x are given by f(x,y) = c
x^3y - y^2x = c
xy(x^2 - y) = c
c = +/-1 level curves are xy(x^2 - y) = +/-1 (not lines)
c = 0 level curves are xy(x^2 - y) = 0 consist of the axes x = 0 and y = 0 and the parabola y = x^2

example:
level curves of f(x,y) = (2x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + y^2)
(2x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + y^2) = c
(2x^2 + 1) = c(x^2 + y^2)
(c - 2)x^2 + cy^2 = 1
c = 1 level curve is y^2 - x^2 = 1 (hyperbola)
c = 2 level curve is y = +/-sqrt(2)/2 (two lines)
c = 3 level curve is x^2 + 3y^2 = 1 (ellipse)

Level curves for f(x,y) = e(^x^2 - y^2)
e(^x^2 - y^2) = c
we must have c > 0, since e^x > 0 for all x
e(^x^2 - y^2) = c
ln(e(^x^2 - y^2)) = ln(c)
x^2 - y^2 = ln(c)
we can split this into three cases, depending on the sign of ln(c)
Case 1: ln(c) > 0 we have the family of hyperbolas x^2 - y^2 = ln(c)
Case 2: ln(c) = 0 we have the lines y = +/-x
Case 3: ln(c) < 0 we have family of hyperbolas y^2 - x^2 = -ln(c)

example:
which of the following represents the level curves of f(x,y) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
(picked the image with circles looks like a dart board)
the range of f(x,y) is [0,infinity) so only considering c >= 0
f(x,y) = c
sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = c
x^2 + y^2 = c^2
gives us a familty of circles centered at the origin

example:
level curves of f(x,y) = ln(y - 2x^2)
(picked the only parabola which is U shape, which y > 0)
the range of f(x,y) is (-infinity, inifinity).
f(x,y) = c
ln(y - 2x^2) = c
y - 2x^2 = e^c
y = 2x^2 + e^c
this equation gives us a family of parabolas w/ vertex at (0,e^c).

===================================================

f(x,y) is continuous at (a,b) if
lim_x->(a,b) f(x,y) = f(a,b)
If a function is continuous at (a,b), then the limit can be evaluated by simply plugging (x,y) = (a,b) into the function

lim_x->(2,1) xy/(x^2 + y^2)
This function is continous for all (x,y) with the exception of (0,0) where the denominator vanishes. The point (2,1) does not cause the demoninator to vanish we can calc the lim by subsituting (x,y) = (2,1) into the function
lim_x->(2,1) xy/(x^2 + y^2) = (2*1)/(2^2 + 1^2) = 2/5

find lim_x->(-1,2) xy^3/x+y
this is continous except when the deminator is zero. We can calc the lim by substitution
lim_x->(-1,2) = (-1)*2^3/(-1)+2
= -8/1
= -8

example:
lim_x->(-2,3) (2x^2 + xy^2)/(x^2 + 2xy)
(2(-2)^2 + (-2)(3)^2)/((-2)^2 + 2(-2)(3))
(8 - 18)/4 - 12
-10/-8 = 5/4

example:
lim_x->(1,1) (x^2y^2)/(x^3 + y^3)
(1^21^2)/(1^3 + 1^3)
= 1/2

Sometimes we may need to simplify a limit before evaluating it
lim_x->(2,-1) (x^2 + 2xy)/(xy + 2y^2)
((2)^2 + 2(2)(-1))/((2)(-1) + 2(-1)^2) = 0/0
we can simplify the limit by factoring the numerator and denominator and then canceling a common factor
lim_x->(2,-1) (x^2 + 2xy)/(xy + 2y^2)
= lim_x->(2,-1) x(x + 2y)/y(x + 2y)
= lim_x->(2,-1) x/y
evaluate
lim_x->(2,-1) x/y = 2/-1 = -2

example:
find lim_x->(-1,1) (x^2y + xy^2)/(x^2 - y^2)
direct substitution leads to the indeterminate form 0/0
= ((-1)^2(1) + (-1)(1)^2)/((-1)^2 - (1)^2) = 0/0
we can simplify by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator
lim_x->(-1,1) xy(x + y)/(x + y)(x - y)
= lim_x->(-1,1) xy/(x - y)
simplify
lim_x->(-1,1) xy/(x - y) = (-1)(1)/(-1 - 1)
= -1/-2 = 1/2

example:
lim_x->(2,2,-1) (xyz - zy^2)/(y^2 - x^2)
= yz(x - y)/-(x - y)(x + y)
= yz/-x - y
= lim_x->(2,2,-1) (2)(-1)/-2-2
= -2/-4 = 1/2

example:
lim_x->(-1,2,2) (z^2 - y^2)/(z^3 - y^2z)
(z^2 - y^2)/z(z^2 - y^2)
= lim_x->(-1,2,2) 1/z
= 1/2

Limits of Multivariable functions using conjugate multiplication
find lim_x->(2,1) (x^2 - 4y)/(x - 2sqrt(y))
direct substitution leads to indeterminate form 0/0
we can simplify the limit by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator lim_x->(2,1):
(x^2 - 4y)(x + 2sqrt(y))/(x - 2sqrt(y))(x + 2sqrt(y))
= (x^2 - 4y)(x + 2sqrt(y))/(x^2 - (2sqrt(y))^2)
= (x^2 - 4y)(x + 2sqrt(y))/(x^2 - 4y)
= (x + 2sqrt(y))
evaluate:
lim_x->(2,1) (x + 2sqrt(y)) = 2 + 2sqrt(1)
= 2 + 2 = 4

example:
lim_x->(0,1) (x^2 - x)/(sqrt(1 + xy) - 1)
(x^2 - x)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)/(sqrt(1 + xy) - 1)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)
= x(x - 1)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)/(sqrt(1 + xy)^2 - 1^2)
= x(x - 1)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)/xy
= (x - 1)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)/y
evaluate
(x - 1)(sqrt(1 + xy) + 1)/y
= (0 - 1)(sqrt(1 + 0*1) + 1)/1
= -2/1 = -2

example:
lim_x->(4,4) (x - y)/(sqrt(x) - sqrt(y))
(x - y)(sqrt(x) + sqrt(y))/(sqrt(x) - sqrt(y))(sqrt(x) + sqrt(y))
= (x - y)(sqrt(x) + sqrt(y))/(sqrt(x)^2 - sqrt(y)^2)
= (x - y)(sqrt(x) + sqrt(y))/(x - y)
= sqrt(x) + sqrt(y)
evaluate
sqrt(4) + sqrt(4) = 2 + 2 = 4

Its easy to show that a limit does not exist for a multivariable function, all we have to do is find two paths on which the limit evaluates to different results.
lim_x->(0,0) y/x+y
direct substitution leads to 0/0, lets compute the limit along the paths y = x and y = x^2, we will see the limit evaluates to different results on these two paths.
taking x -> (0,0) along the path y = x
lim_x->(0,0) y/x+y = lim_x->0 x/x+x
= lim_x->0 x/2x
= lim_x->0 1/2
= 1/2
now along the path y = x^2
lim_x->(0,0) y/x+y = lim_x->0 x^2/(x + x^2)
= x/1 + x
= 0/1+0
= 0
The limit evaluates to different results on these two paths, we can conclude that the limit does not exist (DNE)
lim_x->(0,0) y/x+y = DNE

example:
find lim_x->(0,0) x(x + 2y)/y^2
lets evaluate the limit approaching (0,0) from different paths
along the path y = x
x(x + 2x)/x^2
= 3x^2/x^2
= 3
along the path y = -x
x(x + 2(-x))/(-x)^2
= -x^2/x^2
= -1
the limit evaluates to different reuslts on these two paths, we can conclude that the limit does not exist
lim_x->(0,0) x(x + 2y)/y^2 = DNE

example:
find lim_x->(0,0) (2y^2x + yx^2)/(x^3 + xy^2)
along the path y = x
= (2x^3 + x^3)/(x^3 + x^3)
= 3x^3/2x^3
= 3/2
along the path y = -x
(2x^3 - x^3)/(x^3 + x^3)
= x^3/2x^3
= 1/2
because this evaluates to different results on two different paths we can conclude the limit does not exists
(2y^2x + yx^2)/(x^3 + xy^2) = DNE

example:
find lim_x->(0,0) (xy - xy^2)/(x^2 + 2xy)
along the path y = x
(x^2 - x^3)/3x^2
= (1 - x)/3
= (1 - 0)/3
= 1/3
along the path y = -x
(x(-x) - x(-x)^2)/(x^2 + 2x(-x))
= -x^2 - x^3/-x^2
= lim(1 + x)
= 1 + 0 = 1

===================================================

Partial derivative f with respect to x is computed by taking the derivative of f with respect to x, while treating y as a constant
∂f/∂x
partial derivative is defined as the limit
∂f/∂x = lim_h->0 ((f(x + h, y)) - f(x,y)/h)
derivative of a single variable:
df/dx = lim_h->0 ((f(x + h) - f(x))/h)
partial derivative with respect to y
∂f/∂y = lim_h->0 ((f(x, y + h)) - f(x,y)/h)
notation:
f_x = ∂f/∂x, f_y = ∂f/∂y

example:
f(x,y) = y^2ln(x) express ∂f/∂x as the limit of a difference quotient
the partial derivative of f with respect to x is given by the limit:
∂f/∂x = lim_h->0 ((f(x + h, y)) - f(x,y)/h)
since f(x) = y^2ln(x)
f(x + h, y) = y^2ln(x + h)
∂f/∂x = lim_h->0 ((y^2ln(x + h)) - (y^2ln(x))/h)

example:
f(x,y) = 3x^2y then ∂f/∂x
= lim_h->0 (3(x + h)^2y - 3x^2y)/h

example:
f(x,y) = xsqrt(y) then ∂f/∂y
lim_h->0 (xsqrt(y + h) - xsqrt(y))/h

Computing partial derivatives
consider f(x,y) = xy^2 + e^y
to compute the partial derivative of f with respect to x, (y remains a constant)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(xy^2 + e^y)
= y^2 * ∂/∂x(x) + ∂/∂x(e^y)
= y^2 * 1 + 0
= y^2
e^y vanished, e^y is a function of y only, since we're treating y as a constant, this entire term is treated as a constant and differentiates to zero.
We can do the reverse now take the partial derivative of f with respect to y
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(xy^2 + e^y)
= x * ∂/∂y(y^2) + ∂/∂y(e^y)
= x * (2y) + (e^y)
= 2xy + e^y

when we want to evaluate a partial derivative at a point (x0,y0) we can use the follow notation
∂f(x0,y0)/∂x = ∂f/dx|_(x0,y0) = f_x(x0,y0)

example:
find ∂f/∂y given f(x,y) = 3xln(y) + 2ye^x
= ∂/∂y(3xln(y)) + ∂/∂y(2ye^x)
= 3x * ∂/∂y(ln(y)) + 2e^x * ∂/∂y(y)
= 3x * 1/y + 2e^x * 1
= 3x/y + 2e^x

example:
find ∂f/∂x given f(x,y) = x^2sin(y) + xy
= ∂/∂x(x^2sin(y)) + ∂/∂x(xy)
= sin(y) * ∂/∂x(x^2) + y * ∂/∂x(x)
= sin(y) * 2x + y * 1
= 2xsin(y) + y

example:
find f_y(x,y) for f(x,y) = xy^2 + x^2cos(y)
= f_y(xy^2) + f_y(x^2cos(y))
= x * f_y(y^2) + x^2 * f_y(cos(y))
= x * 2y + x^2 * -sin(y)
= 2xy - x^2sin(y)

Evaluating a partial derivative at a point
f(x,y) = x^2y^2 + sin(x)cos(y), evaluate ∂f/∂x at (pi,2pi)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(x^2y^2 + sin(x)cos(y))
= ∂/∂x(x^2y^2) + ∂/∂x(sin(x)cos(y))
= y^2 * ∂/∂x(x^2) + cos(y) * ∂/∂x(sin(x))
= y^2 * 2x + cos(y) * cos(x)
= 2xy^2 + cos(x)cos(y)
next evaluate at point (pi,2pi)
∂f/∂x|_(pi,2pi) = 2 * pi * (2pi)^2 + cos(pi)*cos(2pi)
= 2pi * 4pi^2 + (-1)*1
= 8pi^3 - 1

example:
f(x,y) = y^2tan(x) + y/x evaluate ∂f/∂x at (pi,2)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(y^2tan(x) + y/x)
= ∂/∂x(y^2tan(x) + x^-1y)
= ∂/∂x(y^2tan(x)) + ∂/∂x(x^-1y)
= y^2 * ∂/∂x(tan(x)) + y * ∂/∂x(x^-1)
= y^2 * sec^2(x) + y * -x^-2
= y^2sec^2(x) - yx^-2
evaluate at (pi,2)
∂f/∂x|_(pi,2) = 2^2sec^2pi - 2(pi)^-2
= 4 - 2/pi^2

example:
f(x,y) = 2^xtan(y) + y/pix^2 evaluate f_x(1,pi/4)
= f_x(2^xtan(y) + (y/pix^2))
= f_x(2^xtan(y) + (y/pi)*(x^-2))
= f_x(2^xtan(y)) + f_x((y/pi)*(x^-2))
= tan(y) * f_x(2^x) + y/pi * f_x(x^-2)
= tan(y) * (2^xln(2)) + y/pi * (-2x^-3)
= tan(y)2^xln2 - 2y/pix^3
evaluate at (1,pi/4)
tan(pi/4)2^1ln2 - (2 * pi/4)/pi * 1^3
= 2ln2 - 1/2

===================================================

We can use the normal rules (product, chain, quotient) to find partial derivatives
f(x,y) = cos(xy^2) + 3x
lets take the partial derivative with respect to x
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(cos(xy^2) + 3x)
= ∂/∂x(cos(xy^2)) + ∂/∂x(3x)
using the chain rule
∂/∂x(cos(xy^2)) + ∂/∂x(3x)
= -sin(xy^2) * ∂/∂x(xy^2) * ∂/∂x(3x)
= -sin(xy^2) * y^2 * ∂/∂x(x) + 3 * ∂/∂x(x)
= -sin(xy^2) * y^2 * 1 + 3 * 1
= 3 - y^2sin(xy^2)
taking the derivative with repect to y
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(cos(xy^2) + 3x)
= ∂/∂y(cos(xy^2)) + ∂/∂y(3x)
chain rule
= -sin(xy^2) * ∂/∂y(xy^2) + ∂/∂y(3x)
= -sin(xy^2) * x * ∂/∂y(y^2) + 0
= -sin(xy^2) * x * 2y
= -2xysin(xy^2)

Applying the chain rule
f(x,y) = ln(y - x^2) evaluate f_x(1,9)
f_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x(ln(y - x^2))
= 1/(y - x^2) * ∂/∂x(y - x^2)
= 1/(y - x^2) * (y * ∂/∂x(1) - ∂/∂x(x^2))
= 1/(y - x^2) * (y * 0 - 2x)
= -2x/(y - x^2)
evaluate at (1,9)
= -2(1)/9-1^2
= -2/8
= -1/4

example:
∂/∂y for f(x,y) = e^(4x - x^4y)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(e^(4x - x^4y))
= e^(4x - x^4y) * ∂/∂y(4x - x^4y)
= e^(4x - x^4y)(∂/∂y(4x) - ∂/∂y(x^4y))
= e^(4x - x^4y)(∂/∂y(4x) - x^4 * ∂/∂y(y))
= e^(4x - x^4y)(0 - x^4 * 1)
= - x^4e^(4x - x^4y)

example:
f(x,y) = e^xy + x^2y evaluate f_y(1,0)
= f_y(e^xy + x^2y)
= f_y(e^xy) + f_y(x^2y)
= e^xy * x * f_y(y) + x^2 * f_y(y)
= xe^xy * 1 + x^2 * 1
= xe^xy + x^2
evaluate at (1,0)
= 1 * e^1*0 + 1^2
= 2

Applying the product rule
∂f/∂x for f(x,y) = x^2yln(x)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(x^2yln(x))
= y * ∂/∂x(x^2ln(x))
= y * (∂/∂x(x^2) * ln(x) + x^2 * ∂/∂x(ln(x)))
= y * (2x * ln(x) + x^2 * (1/n))
= y(2xln(x) + x)
= xy(2ln(x) + 1)

example:
∂f/∂y for f(x,y) = x^2 + xysin(y)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(x^2 + xysin(y))
= ∂/∂y(x^2) + ∂/∂y(xysin(y))
= ∂/∂y(x^2) + x * ∂/∂y(ysin(y))
= 0 + x(∂/∂y(y) * sin(y) + y * ∂/∂y(sin(y))
= x(1 * sin(y) + y * cos(y))
= x(sin(y) + ycos(y))

example:
f(x,y) = ye^(xy) - x^2y^2 evaluate ∂f/∂y at (1,1)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(ye^(xy) - x^2y^2)
= ∂/∂y(ye^(xy)) - ∂/∂y(x^2y^2)
= ∂/∂y(ye^(xy)) - x^2 * (2y)
= ∂/∂y(y)*e^(xy) + y * ∂/∂y(e^(xy)) - x^2 * (2y)
= (1 * e^(xy) + y * e^(xy) * ∂/∂y(xy)) - 2(x^2)y
= (e^(xy) + y * e^(xy) * x * ∂/∂y(y)) - 2(x^2)y
= (e^(xy) + y * e^(xy) * x * 1) - 2(x^2)y
= e^(xy) + xye^xy - 2(x^2)y
evaluate at (1,1)
∂f/∂y|_(1,1) = e^(1*1) + 1 * 1 * e^(1*1) - 2 * 1^2 * 1
= e + e - 2
= 2e - 2

Applying the quotient rule
f(x,y) = (4x - y)/(x + y^2) evaluate ∂f/∂x at (2,-1)
∂/∂x((4x - y)/(x + y^2))
= ∂/∂x(4x - y) * (x + y^2) - (4x - y) * ∂/∂x(x + y^2)/(x + y^2)^2
= 4 * (x + y^2) - (4x - y) * 1/(x + y^2)^2
= 4x + 4y^2 - 4x + y/(x + y^2)^2
= 4y^2 + y/(x + y^2)^2
evaluate at (2,-1)
∂f/∂x|_(2,-1) = 4(-1)^2 + (-1)/(2 + (-1)^2)^2
= 4 - 1/3^2
= 1/3

example:
f(x,y) = e^y^2/x^2 - 2y the partial derivative of f with respect to y is given by
∂f/∂y = h(x,y)e^y^2/(x^2 - 2y)^2
find h(x,y)
∂f/∂y(e^y^2) * (x^2 - 2y) - e^y^2 ∂f/∂y(x^2 - 2y)/(x^2 - 2y)^2
e^y^2 * ∂f/∂y(y^2) * (x^2 - 2y) - e^y^2 * (-2)/(x^2 - 2y)^2
e^y^2 * 2y * (x^2 - 2y) + 2e^y^2/(x^2 - 2y)^2
(2x^2y - 4y^2 + 2)e^y^2/(x^2 - 2y)^2
h(x,y) = 2x^2y - 4y^2 + 2

example:
f(x,y) = cos(x)/x + y evulate ∂f/∂x at (pi,0)
= ∂f/∂x(cos(x)/x + y)
= ∂f/∂x(cos(x)) * (x + y) - cos(x) ∂f/∂x((x + y))/(x + y)^2
= -sin(x) * (x + y) - cos(x) * 1/(x + y)^2
evaulate at (pi,0)
= (0) * (pi + 0) - (-1) * 1/((pi) + 0)^2
= 1/pi^2

Partial derivatives applies to many variables
∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z and so on

example:
g(x,y,z) = 2(x + 1)e^z + yz evaluate ∂g/∂z at (1,1,1)
∂g/∂z = ∂z(2(x + 1)e^z + yz)
= ∂g/∂z(2(x + 1)e^z) + ∂g/∂z(yz)
= 2(x + 1) * ∂g/∂z(e^z) + ∂g/∂z(yz)
= 2(x + 1)e^z + y
evaluate at (1,1,1)
∂g/∂z|_(1,1,1) = 2(1 + 1)e^1 + 1
= 4e + 1

example:
f(x,y,z) = x^2y^2 - ln(xz) evaluate ∂f/∂y at (1,0,1)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(x^2y^2 - ln(xz))
= ∂/∂y(x^2y^2) - ∂f/∂y(ln(xz))
= x^2 * ∂/∂y(y^2) - (0))
= x^2 * (2y)
= 2x^2y
evaluate at (1,0,1)
∂f/∂y|_(1,0,1) = 2(1)^2(0)
= 0

example:
∂f/∂z for f(x,y,z) = ysqrt(x^2 + z^2)
∂f/∂z = ∂/∂z(ysqrt(x^2 + z^2)) 
= y * ∂/∂z((x^2 + z^2)^1/2)
= y * 1/2((x^2 + z^2)^-1/2) * ∂/∂z(x^2 + z^2)
= y/2sqrt(x^2 + z^2) * ∂/∂z(x^2 + z^2)
= y/2sqrt(x^2 + z^2) * (∂f/∂z(x^2) + ∂f/∂z(z^2))
= y/2sqrt(x^2 + z^2) * (0 + 2z)
= yz/sqrt(x^2 + z^2)

Geometric interpretations of partial derivatives
consider the surface z = f(x,y) = 18 - x^2 - y^2 and the plane x = 3. The intersection of the surface and the plane forms a downward parabolic curve. A point P(3,2,5) is plotted and a tangent line is drawn through that point.

To find the slope of the tangent, take the partial derivative ∂f/∂y and evaluate at P(3,2,5)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(18 - x^2 - y^2)
= -2y
∂f/∂y|_P = -2(2)
= -4
To verify this is correct we can find the equation of the downward parabolic curve and then use single variable calculus to compute the slope of the tangent line.
To find the equation of the downward parabolic curve we can substitute the equation of the plane (x = 3) into the equation of the surface (f(x,y) = 18 - x^2 - y^2)
f(3,y) = 18 - 3^2 - y^2
= 9 - y^2
The equation of the downward parabolic curve is z = g(y) = 9 - y^2 in the yz-plane. To find the slope of the tangent to g(y) at P, we can use single-variable calculus. We differentiate g(y) and evaluate it at P(3,2,5) this gives
g'(y) = -2y
g'(2) = -2(2)
= -4

∂f/∂y we differentiate f with respect to y and treat x as a constant. This is the same as finding the intersection of z = f(x,y) with the plane x = x0 and calc the slop of the resulting curve.

theorem:
Suppose that a surface z = f(x,y) and a plane x = x0 intersect on a curve C, and suppose that P(x0,y0,z0) lies on C. Then ∂f/∂y evaluated at P gives the slope of the tangent to C at P

similar for the intersection of a surface and a plane y = y0
(same as above except y = y0 and ∂f/∂x)

Finding the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point
A surface S is defined by z = f(x,y), the curve C is the intersection of S with the plane x = 2 given that the point P(2,1,8) lies on C, and that f_y = 4x/y - 4x^2y find the slope of the tangent to C at P
the curve C is the intersection of the surface z = f(x,y) with the plane x = 2. The slope of the tangent to the curve C at the point P(2,1,8) will be given by the partial derivative f_y(2,1)
to get the slope evaluate the partial derviative f_y(x,y) at (2,1)
f_y(2,1) = 4(2)/(1) - 4(2)^2(1)
= 8 - 16
= -8

example:
A surface S is defined by z = f(x,y). The curve C is the intersection of S with the plane y = 0. Given that the point P with x-coordinate pi/2 lies on C and that f_x = ycos(x) + cos(y) find the slop of the tagent to C at P
f_x(x,y) at (pi/2, 0)
= 0cos(pi/2) = cos(0)
= 0 + 1 = 1

example:
A surface S is defined by z = f(x,y). The curve C is the intersection of S with the plane y = 3. The point P(2,3,9) lies on C and f_x(6x - y) find slope of the tangent to C at P
to get the slope we evaluate the partial derivative f_x(x,y) at (2,3)
f_x(2,3) = 6(2) - (3) = 9

Finding the equation of the tangent line to a curve at a point.
Curve C is the intersection of a surface S, defined by z = f(x,y) with the plane y = pi. Given that the point P(1,pi,-1) lies on C and that f_x = ycos(xy) + cos(y) find the equations of the tagent line to C at P.
The curve C is the intersection of the surface z = f(x,y) with the plane y = pi. The slope of the tagent to the curve at the point P(1,pi,-1) will be given by the partial derivative ∂z/∂x|_(1,pi)
to get the slope, evaluate ∂z/∂x at (1,pi)
= picos(1 * pi) + cos(pi)
= pi(-1) + (-1)
= -pi - 1
point-slope form of a straight line:
z - z|_(1,pi) = ∂z/∂x|_(1,pi) (x - 1)
z - (-1) = (-pi - 1)(x - 1)
z + 1 = (-pi - 1)x + pi + 1
z = -(pi + 1)x + pi
^ this represents a line in the xz-plane. The xz-plane through the point P(1,pi,-1) has the equation y = pi
The tagent line to the curve C at P(1,pi,-1) is given by the intersection of the planes:
{
	y = pi
	z = -(pi + 1)x + pi
}

The curve C is the intersection of a surface S, defined by z = f(x,y) with the plane y = 1 given that the point P(1,1,0) lies on C, and that f_x = 3x + 6xln(xy) find the equations of the tangent line to C at P
∂z/∂x at (1,1)
= 3(1) + 6(1)ln(1*1)
= 3 + 6ln(1)
= 3
use the point slope form of a striaght line
z - z|_(1,1) = ∂z/∂x|_(1,1) (x - 1)
z - 0 = 3(x - 1)
z = 3x - 3
the tangent line to curve C at P(1,1,0) can be given as the intersection as:
{
	y = 1
	z = 3x - 3
}

The curve C is the intersection of a surface S, defined by z = f(x,y) with the plane x = 1. The point P(1,2,4) lies on C and that f_y(3x + y/sqrt(6xy + y^2)) find the equations of the tangent line to C at P.
= (3(1) + (2))/sqrt(6(1)(2) + (2)^2)
= 5/sqrt(16)
= 5/4
z - z|_(1,2) = ∂z/∂y|_(1,2) (y - 1)
z - 4 = 5/4(y - 2)
z = 5/4y + 3/2
{
	x = 1
	z = 5/4y + 3/2
}

Finding the tangent vector to a curve at a point (many steps involved!)
Curve C is the intersection of surface S z = f(x,y) with plane y = 1 the point P(0,1,1) lies on C and that f_x = ((sqrt(2)pi)/4)(sin(2x + piy/4)) find a tangent vector C at P.
The curve C is the intersection of the surface with the plane y = 1. So the slope of the tangent to the curve C at the point P will be given by the partial derivative f_x(0,1)
To get the slop we need to evaluate the partial derivative f_x(x,y) at (0,1)
f_x(0,1) = (sqrt(2)pi)/4)(sin(2(0) + pi(1)/4)
= (sqrt(2)pi)/4)sin(pi/4)
= pi/4
now use the point slope form of a straight line:
z - f(0,1) = f_x(0,1)(x - 0)
z - 1 = (pi/4)x
z = (pi/4)x + 1
^ this represents a line in the xz-plane, the xz-plane through the point P(0,1,1) has the equation y = 1
The tagent line to the curve C at P(0,1,1) is given by the intersection of the following planes
{
	y = 1
	z = (pi/4)x + 1
}
To find a tangent vector we can find a normal vector to each plane and compute their cross product.
For the plane y = 1 we write 0x + 1y + 0z = 1 and fine the normal vector n1 = <0,1,0>
(review)
For the plane z = (pi/4)x we write -pi/4x + 0y + 1z = 1 and find the normal vector n2 = <-pi/4,0,1>
cross product:
n1 x n2 = <0,1,0> x <-pi/4,0,1>
= |i     j     k|
  |0     1     0|
  |-pi/4 0     1|
= i + (pi/4)k
We've found a tangent vector, and this could be our final answer, just to make our answer a little nicer we can multiply the vector by 4 to yield a simpler, parallel vector:
4 * (i + (pi/4)k)
= 4i + (pi)k

example:
Curve C is the intersection of a surface S defined by z = f(x,y) with the plane y = -3 the point P(2,-3,3) lies on C and that f_x = 6(x - 1) which of the following gives a tangent vector to C at P
f_x(2,-3) = 6((2) - 1)
= 6 
now use the point slope form of a straight line:
z - 3 = 6(x - 2)
z - 3 = 6x - 12
z = 6x - 9
the tagent line to curve C at point(1,1,0) can be given as the intersection of two planes
{
	y = -3
	z = 6x - 9
}
for the plane y = -3 a normal vector to the plane is n1 = <0,1,0>
for the plane z = 6x - 9 (or 6x - z - 9 = 0) a normal vector to the plane in n2 <6,0,-1>
to find a direction bector for the tangent line we calculate the cross product of these normal vectors:
n1xn2 = <0,1,0> x <6,0,1>
= |i  j  k|
  |0  1  0|
  |6  0 -1|
= -i - 6k
= <-1,0,-6>
since <-1,0,-6> is parallel to the tangent line then -<-1,0,-6> = <1,0,6> is also parallel to it.

example:
curve C is the intersection of a surface S, z = f(x,y) with the plane x = 1. P(1,-1,2) point lies on C and that f_y = x^2(2xy - 1) what is the tangent vector to C at P.
f_y(1,-1) = (1)^2(2(1)(-1) - 1)
= -3
now use the point slope form of a straight line:
z - 2 = -3(y + 1)
z - 2 = -3y - 3
z = -3y - 1
{
	x = 1
	z = -3y - 1
}
for the plane x = 1, normal vector n1 = <1,0,0>
for the plane z = -3y - 1 (or -3y - z - 1 = 0), a normal vector to the plane is n2 = <0,-3,-1>
= |i  j  k|
  |1  0  0|
  |0 -3  1|
= j - 3k
a tangent vector to C at P is j - 3k

===================================================

To compute the set where ∂f/∂x exists take the intersection of the domain of the original function (D_f) with the domain of the partial derivative (D_f_x)
D_f ∩ D_f_x = {(x,y) : x != 0} ∩ {(x,y) : xy > 0}
= {(x,y) : xy > 0}
we can conclude that ∂f/∂x exists on the set {(x,y) : xy > 0}

finding the domain where partial derivative exists
f(x,y) = y/x find set of values (x,y) on which ∂f/∂y exists.
The partial derivative of a function exists where the origin function is defined and the partial derivative is defined
f(x,y) is not defined when x = 0
D_f = {(x,y) : x != 0}
compute partial derivative of f(x,y) with respect to y
∂f/∂y(y/x)
= 1/x
The partial derivative f_y(x,y) is also not defined for x = 0
D_f_y {(x,y) : x != 0}
D_f ∩ D_f_y = {(x,y) : x != 0} ∩ {(x,y) : x != 0}
= {(x,y) : x != 0}
∂f/∂y exists on the set {(x,y) : x != 0}

example:
f(x,y) = sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2) ∂f/∂x
1 - x^2 - y^2 >= 0
x^2 + y^2 <= 1
D_f = {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 <= 1}
compute the partial derivative of f(x,y) with respect to x
f_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x(sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2))
= -2x/2sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)
= -x/sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)
f_x(x,y) is defined only for
1 - x^2 - y^2 > 0
x^2 + y^2 < 1
domain of f_x is
D_f_x = {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 < 1}
D_f ∩ D_f_x = {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 <= 1} ∩ {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 < 1}
= {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 < 1}

example:
f(x,y) = arctan(x/y) find set of values (x,y) on which ∂f/∂y
D_f = {(x,y) : y != 0}
∂/∂y(arctan(x/y))
= (-x/y^2)/(1 + (x/y)^2)
= -x/(y^2 + x^2)
f_y(x,y) is not defined at the point (0,0) the domain of f_y is
D_f_y = {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 != 0}
D_f ∩ D_f_y {(x,y) : y != 0} ∩ {(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 != 0}

Finding the domain where all partial derivatives exist
f(x,y) = ln(x/y^2)
∂f/∂x = 1/x, ∂f/∂y = -2/y
find the set of values (x,y) on which all partial derivatives of f exist.
f(x,y) = ln(x/y^2) is defined only when x/y^2 > 0 domain is
D_f = {(x,y) : x > 0, y != 0}
f_x(x,y) = 1/x is defined only when x != 0 domain is
D_f_x = {(x,y) : x != 0}
f_y(x,y) = -2/y is defined only when y != 0 domain is
D_f_y = {(x,y) : y != 0}
D_f ∩ D_f_x ∩ D_f_y = {(x,y) : x > 0, y != 0} ∩ {(x,y) : x != 0} ∩ {(x,y) : y != 0}
= {(x,y) : x > 0, y != 0}

example:
given that f(x,y,z) = arcsin(xyz)
∂f/∂x = yz/sqrt(1 - (xyz)^2)
∂f/∂y = xz/sqrt(1 - (xyz)^2)
∂f/∂z = xy/sqrt(1 - (xyz)^2)
find the values on which all partial derivatives of f exist
arcsin(xyz) is defined only when -1 <= xyz <= 1 domain of f is
D_f = {(xyz) : -1 <= xyz <= 1}
∂f/∂x = yz/sqrt(1 - (xyz)^2)
1 - xyz^2 > 0
xyz^2 < 1
|xyz| < 1
which gives -1 < xyz < 1 domain is
D_f_x = {(x,y,z) : -1 < xyz < 1}
D_f_y = D_f_x = D_f_z
D_f ∩ D_f_x ∩ D_f_y ∩ D_f_z
= D_f ∩ D_f_x 
= {(x,y,x) : -1 <= xyz <= 1} ∩ {(x,y,z) : -1 < xyz < 1}
= {(x,y,z) : -1 < xyz < 1}

example:
f(x,y) = xln(x,y)
∂f/∂x = 1 + ln(xy)
∂f/∂y = x/y
f(x,y) = xln(x,y) is only defined when xy > 0 domain is
D_f = {(x,y) : xy > 0}
f_x(x,y) = 1 + ln(xy) is defined only when xy > 0
D_f_x = {(x,y) : xy > 0}
f_y(x,y) = x/y is defined only when y != 0
D_f_y = {(x,y) : y != 0}
D_f ∩ D_f_x ∩ D_f_y
= {(x,y) : xy > 0} ∩ {(x,y) : xy > 0} ∩ {(x,y) : y != 0}
= {(x,y) : xy > 0}

example:
f(x,y,z) = xzln(x + y + z)
partial derivatives of f
∂f/∂x = zln(x + y + z) + xz/(x + y + z)
∂f/∂y = xz/(x + y + z)
∂f/∂z = xln(x + y + z) + xz/(x + y + z)
substituting specific values
f(-1,-1,-1) = (-1)(-1)ln(-1 - 1 - 1) = ln(-3)
is undefined since logarithm exists only for positives
f_y(1,0,-1) = (1)(-1)/(1 + 0 - 1) = -1/0
undefined division by 0
f_z(1,1,1) = (1)ln(1 + 1 + 1) + (1)(1)/(1+1+1) = ln(3) + 1/3
^ this is defined

example:
f(x,y,z) = z^2/(x^2 - y^2)
f_x(1,-1,0) = -2xz/(x^2 - y^2)^2
= -2(1)(0)/((1)^2 - (-1)^2)^2
= 0/0 undefined
f_x(1,-1,0) = -2xz/(x^2 - y^2)^2
= -2(0)(1)/((0)^2 - (1)^2)^2
= 0
f_z(1,1,0) = 2z/(x^2 - y^2)
= 2(0)/((1)^2 - (1)^2)
= 0/0 undefined
f_x(1,-1,0) is the only one that is defined.

example:
f(x,y) = ln(x/x + y)
f_x(0,1) = y/(x^2 + xy)
= (1)/((0)^2 + (0)(1))
1/0 undefined
f_y(0,1) = -1/(x + y)
= -1/(0 + 1) = -1/1 = -1 is defined
f_x(1,1) = f_y(1,1) = (1)/((1)^2 + (1)(1)) is defined

Partial differentiability does not imply continuity
from single-variable calculus if a function y = f(x) is differentiable at a point then its continuous at that point

For a multivariable function, even if all partial derivatives are defined at a certain point it does not mean that the function is continuous at that point

Partial differentiability does not imply continuity in the case of a multivariable function is that the existence of partial derivatives f_x and f_y depend on behavior of f parallel to the x and y-axes
the continuity of f depends on its behavior as we approach (x0,y0) from any direction 
consider the following multivariable function:

f(x,y) = {
	xy/(x^2 + y^2) (x,y) != (0,0)
	0              (x,y) = (0,0)
}
the function f is defined at (0,0)

f_x, f_y are both defined at (0,0)
f_x(0,0) lim_h->0 1/h[f(0 + h, 0) - f(0,0)]
= lim_h->0 1/h[(h)(0)/(h^2 + 0^2) - 0]
= lim_h->0 1/h[0 - 0]
= 0
f_y = lim_h->0 1/h[f(0, 0 + h) - f(0,0)]
= lim_h->0 1/h[(0)(h)/(0^2 + h^2) - 0]
= lim_h->0 1/h[0 - 0]
= 0

For f to be continuous at (0,0) the limit of the function must be equal to the function value, regardless of the path taken:
lim_(x,y)->(0,0) = f(0,0) = 0

This is not the case here when we evaluate the limit along the path y = x
lim_(x,y)->(0,0) f(x,y) = lim_y->0 (x * x)/(x^2 + x^2)
= lim_y->0 x^2/2x^2
= lim_y->0 1/2
= 1/2
!= 0
our f(x,y) is not continuous at point (0,0) even though both of its partial derivatives exist.

===================================================

Computing second derivatives of multivariable functions
two variable function
f(x,y) = xy^2 + e^(xy)
first order partial derivatives:
f_x(x,y) = y^2 + ye^(xy)
f_y(x,y) = 2xy + xe^(xy)
f_x(x,y), and f_y(x,y) are themselves that are differentiable, we can compute the second-order partial derivatives as well
f_x_x(x,y) = ∂f/∂x(f_x(x,y)) = y^2e^(xy)
f_x_y(x,y) = ∂f/∂y(f_x(x,y)) = 2x + xye^(xy)
f_y_x(x,y) = ∂f/∂x(f_y(x,y)) = 2y + xye^(xy)
f_y_y(x,y) = ∂f/∂y(f_y(x,y)) = 2x + x^2e^(xy)
f_x_y and f_y_x are called mixed partial derivatives because they involve taking the partial derivatives with respect to different variables, x and y
alternative notions
∂^2/∂x^2(f) = ∂^2f/∂x^2(f) = f_x_x
∂^2/∂y∂x(f) = ∂^2f/∂y∂x = f_x_y
∂^2/∂y^2(f) = ∂^2f/y^2 = f_y_y
∂^2/∂x∂y(f) = ∂^2f/∂x∂y = f_y_x
in our example
f_x_y(x,y) = 2y + xye^(xy) = f_y_x(x,y)
almost always f_x_y = f_y_x

example:
find ∂^2f/∂x∂y given that ∂f/∂y = 2y/(x + y^2)
∂^2f/∂x∂y = ∂/∂x(∂f/∂y)
= ∂/∂x(2y/(x + y^2))
= 2y * ∂/∂x((x + y^2)^-1)
= -2y(x + y^2)^-2 * 1
= -2y/(x + y^2)^2

example:
f(x,y) calculate ∂^2f/∂y∂x
∂f/∂x = y/(x + y)
∂f/∂y(y/(x + y))
= (1 * (x + y) - y * 1)/(x + y)^2
= x + y - y/(x + y)^2
= x/(x + y)^2

example:
f(x,y) calculate ∂^2f/∂y∂x
∂f/∂y = 2x^2ye^x
∂/∂x(2x^2ye^x)
= 2y * ∂/∂x(x^2e^2)
= 2y(2xe^x + x^2e^x)
= 2xye^x(2 + x)

Computing expressions involving second-order partial derivatives
f_x_y(x,y) + f_y_x(x,y) given that f_x(x,y) = ycos(xy) and f_y(x,y) = xcos(xy)
f_x_y(x,y) = ∂/∂y(f_x(x,y))
= ∂/∂y(ycos(xy))
= 1 * cos(xy) + y(-sin(xy) * x)
= cos(xy) - xysin(xy)
f_y_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x(f_y(xy))
= ∂/∂x(xcos(xy))
= 1 * cos(xy) + x(-sin(xy) * y)
= cos(xy) - xysin(xy)
f_x_y(x,y) + f_y_x(x,y) = cos(xy) - xysin(xy) + cos(xy) - xysin(xy)
= 2(cos(xy) - xysin(xy))

example:
find g_x_y(x,y) + g_x_x(xy) given
g_x(x,y) = 1/(x - 3y)
= ∂/∂y(1/(x - 3y))
= 1 * ((x - 3y)^-1)
= -1 * ∂/∂y((x - 3y)^-2)
= 3/(x - 3y)^2
∂/∂x(1/(x - 3y))
= -1/(x - 3y)^2
g_x_y(x,y) + g_x_x(xy) = 3/(x - 3y)^2 + (-1/(x - 3y)^2)
= 2/(x - 3y)^2

example:
find f_x_y(x,y) + f_y_x(xy) given
f_x(x,y) = 2xsin(y) and f_y(x,y) = x^2cos(y)
∂/∂y(2xsin(y))
= 2xcos(y)
∂/∂x(x^2cos(y))
2xcos(y)
2xcos(y) + 2xcos(y) = 4xcos(y)

We can define other higher order partial derivatives such as f_xxy f_xxyy f_xyxy etc
(review)
f(x,y,z) = zcos(xy) has the first-order partial derivative
f_y(x,y,z) = -xzsin(xy)
and the second-order partial derivative
f_yx(x,y,z) = -xyzcos(xy) - zsin(xy)
third-order partial derivative f_yxx
= ∂/∂x(f_yx(x,y))
= ∂/∂x(-xyzcos(xy) - zsin(xy))
= -yzcos(xy) - xyz(-sin(xy) * y) - zcos(xy) * y
= xy^2zsin(xy) - 2yzcos(xy)

example:
g_xyz(x,y,z) at (1,2,3) if g_x(x,y,z) = 2xyz + y^3
∂/∂y(2xyz + y^3)
= 2xz + 3y^2
g_xyz = ∂/∂z(2xz + 3y^2)
= 2x
g_xyz(1,2,3) = 2(1)
= 2

example:
(review)
f_xyz(1,1,1) for f(x,y,z) = yz/(x - 2z)
∂/∂x(yz/(x - 2z))
= -yz/(x - 2z)^2
∂/∂y(-yz/(x - 2z)^2)
= -z/(x - 2z)^2
∂/∂z(-z/(x - 2z)^2)
= -(1 * (x - 2z)^2 - z * 2(x - 2z) * (-2))/(x - 2z)^4
= -((x - 2z)^2 + 4z(x - 2z))/(x - 2z)^4
= -(x - 2z + 4z)/(x - 2z)^3
= -(x + 2z)/(x - 2z)^3
f_xyz(1,1,1) = -(1 + 2 * 1)/(1 - 2 * 1)^3 = 3

example:
f_xyx(x,y) given f(x,y) = x^2y + y^2ln(y)
∂/∂x(x^2y + y^2ln(y))
= 2xy
∂/∂y(2xy)
= 2x
∂/∂x(2x)
= 2

===================================================

f(x,y) = xy^2 - x^3y first order derivatives
∂f/∂x(x,y) = y^2 - 3x^y & ∂f/∂y(x,y) = 2xy - x^3
second order mixed partial derivatives
∂^2f/∂y∂x = 2y - 3x^2 & ∂^2f/∂x∂y = 2y - 3x^2
they are equal 
∂^2f/∂y∂x = ∂^2f/∂x∂y
if f(x,y) has continuous first-order partial derivatives on an open set U and the second-order mixed partial derivatives exist and are continuous on U, then the mixed partial derivatives are equal everywhere on U

example:
f(x,y) all of its first and second order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U. Find the values of a and b
f_x(x,y) = 6xy + axy^3 - 5
f_y(x,y) = 3x^2 + bx^2y^2
f_y(2,-1) = -24
∂f/∂y(6xy + axy^3 - 5)
= 6x + 3axy^2 - 0
= 6x + 3axy^2
∂f/∂x(3x^2 + bx^2y^2)
= 6x + 2bxy^2
Since the function and its first and second order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U the mixed partial derivatives must be equal.
f_xy(x,y) = f_yx(x,y)
6x + 3axy^2 = 6x + 2bxy^2
the coefficients of xy^2: 3a = 2b
since f_y(2,-1) = -24
f_y(2,-1) = -24
(plugging into our original equation)
3(2)^2 + b(2)^2(-1)^2 = -24
12 + 4b = -24
4b = -36
b = -9
3a = 2b
3a = 2(-9)
3a = -18
a = -6 and b = -9

example:
f(x,y) all of its first and second-order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U find the values of a and b
f_x(x,y) = ax^2y - 4y^2 + 3
f_y(x,y) = 2x^3 + bxy - 8
∂f/∂y(ax^2y - 4y^2 + 3)
= ax^2 - 8y
∂f/∂x(2x^3 + bxy - 8)
= 6x^2 + by
since the function and its first and second-order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U the mixed partial derivatives must be equal (indentity)
ax^2 - 8y = 6x^2 + by
equating the coefficients of x^2 and y a = 6 and b = -8

example:
f(x,y) all of its first and second-order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U find the values of a and b
f_x(x,y) = x + ay^2 - 1
f_y(x,y) = bxy - 5y + 3
f_x(1,1) = 2
∂f/∂y(x + ay^2 - 1)
= 2ay
∂f/∂x(by - 5y + 3)
= bx
2ay = by
equating the coefficients of y we get
b = 2a
f_x(1,1) = 2
(plugging into our original equation)
1 + a * (1)^2 - 1 = 2
a = 2
b = 2a = 2(2) = 4

example:
f_x(x,y) = x + 4y and f_y(x,y) = 3x - y
f_x(x,y) = 2x and f_y(x,y) = 0
f_x(x,y) = 2x + cos(x)cos(y) and f_y(x,y) = e^y - sin(x)sin(y)
∂f/∂y(x + 4y)
= 4
∂f/∂x(3x - y)
= 3
4 != 3
∂f/∂y(2x)
= 0
∂f/∂x(0)
= 0
∂f/∂y(2x + cos(x)cos(y))
= -cos(x)sin(y)
∂f/∂x(e^y - sin(x)sin(y))
= -cos(x)sin(y)
2 out of the three equations above are continuous

example:
f_x(x,y) = x^3y - x and f_y(x,y) = xy^3 - y
f_x(x,y) = e^(x+y) - 2y and f_y(x,y) = e^(x+y) - 2x
f_x(x,y) = sqrt(x - 1) and f_y(x,y) = -3
∂f/∂y(x^3y - x)
x^3
∂f/∂x(xy^3 - y)
y^3
∂f/∂y(e^(x+y) - 2y)
e^(x+y) - 2
∂f/∂x(e^(x+y) - 2x)
e^(x+y) - 2
∂f/∂y(sqrt(x - 1))
= 0
∂f/∂x(-3)
= 0
only 2 out of three f_xy = f_yx are continuous

∂^2f/∂x∂y = ∂^2f/∂y∂x
this result extends to higher-order partial derivatives. If the third-order partial derivatives of f(x,y) are also continuous everywhere on U, then the third-order mixed partial derivatives are independent of the order in which the differentiation is performed.

∂^3f/∂x∂x∂y = ∂^3f/∂y∂x∂x
this is a distinct permutation of the symbols ∂x, ∂x, and ∂y any permutation of these symbols gives the same result
∂^3f/∂x∂x∂y = ∂^3f/∂x∂y∂x

this does not mean all third partial derivatives are equal
∂^3f/∂x∂x∂y != ∂^3f/∂x∂y∂y
These are not equal as the right denominator is not a permutation of left denomenator ∂x∂x∂y

example:
f(x,y,z) and all of its higher-order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U
∂^2f/∂x^2 = (xy^2 + 2y)e^(xy) + 2z^3
∂^2f/∂x∂z = 6xz^2
evaluate at point (1,0,1)
∂^3f/∂x∂y∂x + ∂^3f/∂z∂x∂z
∂f/∂y((xy^2 + 2y)e^(xy) + 2z^3)
= (xy^2 + 2y)xe^(xy) + (2xy + 2)e^(xy)
= (x^2y^2 + 4xy + 2)e^(xy)
∂f/∂z(6xz^2)
= 12xz
(2) + 12 = 14

example:
f(x,y,z) and all of its higher-order partial derivatives are continuous on an open set U, evaluate f_xyx(pi,1) if f_xx(x,y) = y^2e^ysin(xy)
∂f/∂y(y^2e^ysin(xy)
= 2y * e^ysin(xy) + e^y * y^2sin(xy) + xcos(xy) * y^2e^y
= ye^y(2sin(xy) + ysin(xy) + xycos(xy))
evaulate at (pi,1)
= 1*e^1(2sin(1 * pi) + 1*sin(1*pi) + 1 * picos(1*pi)) = -pie
(pi to the e not "pie" :))

===================================================

Similar to tangent lines for single variable functions, we can think of the tangent plane to a surface at a point as the plane that touches the surface at that point.

The equation of the tangent plane to a surface z = f(x,y) at the point (x0,y0,z0) where z0 = f(x0,y0) can be found using
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0)

consider the surface
z = 4 - x^2 - y^2
The equation of the tangent plane to the surface at point (0,sqrt(2),2)
first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(4 - x^2 - y^2) = -2x
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(4 - x^2 - y^2) = -2y
evaluate the partial derivatives at (x,y) = (0,sqrt(2))
∂f/∂x(0,sqrt(2)) = -2(0) = 0
∂f/∂y(0,sqrt(2)) = -2(sqrt(2)) = -2sqrt(2)
equation of the tagent plane:
z - 2 = (x - 0)∂f/∂x(0,sqrt(2)) + (y,-sqrt(2))∂f/∂y(0,sqrt(2))
z - 2 = 0(x - 0) - 2sqrt(2)(y - sqrt(2))
z - 2 = -2sqrt(2)y + 4
2sqrt(2)y + z - 6 = 0
^ cartesian equation of the tangent plane.

A surface z = f(x,y) is differentiable at a point P iff it has a unique tangent plane at P. This means in the proximity of P, the surface z = f(x,y) can be approximated as a plane.
This is analogous to the case of one variable functions. y = f(x) is differentiable at a point P if it has a unique tangent line at P. This is the same as saying that, in the proximity of P, the curve y = f(x) can be approximated as a striaght line

Calculating the equation of a tangent plane
Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface
z = x^2 + xy at (1,2,3)
the cartesian equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = f(x,y) at the point (x0,y0,z0) on the surface:
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0)
find partial derivatives
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(x^2 + xy)
= 2x + y
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(x^2 + xy)
= x
evaluate the partial derivatives at (1,2)
∂/∂x(1,2) = 2(1) + 2 = 4
∂/∂y(1,2) = 1
tangent plane:
z - 3 = (x - 1)∂f/∂x(1,2) + (y - 2)∂f/∂y(1,2)
z - 3 = 4(x - 1) + 1(y - 2)
z - 3 = 4x + y - 6
-4x - y + z + 3 = 0
4x + y - z - 3 = 0

example:
find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface
z = sqrt(x^2 + 2y^3) - y at (3,2,3)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(sqrt(x^2 + 2y^3) - y)
= x/sqrt(x^2 + 2y^3)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂y(sqrt(x^2 + 2y^3) - y)
3y^2/x^2 + 2y^3 - 1
partials at (3,2)
∂f/∂x = (3)/sqrt((3)^2 + 2(2)^3) = 3/5
∂f/∂y = 3(2)^2/sqrt((3)^2 + 2(2)^3) - 1 = 12/5 - 1 = 7/5
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0)
z - 3 = 3/5(x - 1) + 7/5(y - 2)
5z - 15 = 3(x - 3) + 7(y - 2)
5z - 15 = 3x - 9 + 7y - 14
-3x - 7y + 5z + 8 = 0
3x + 7y - 5z - 8 = 0

example:
find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = y^2e^(2x) - 1 at (0,2,3)
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(y^2e^(2x) - 1)
= 2y^2e^(2x)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(y^2e^(2x) - 1)
= 2ye^(2x)
substitute
∂/∂x = 2y^2e^(2x) = 2(2)^2e^(2(0)) = 8
∂f/∂y = 2ye^(2x) = 2(2)e^(2(0)) = 4
z - 3 = 8(x - 0) + 4(y - 2)
z - 3 = 8x + 4y - 8
-z + 3 + 8x + 4y - 8 = 0
-z - 5 + 8x + 4y = 0
8x + 4y - z - 5 = 0

A function of three variables w = f(x,y,z) is differentiable at (x0,y0,z0) if admits a unique tangent hyperplane at (x0,y0,z0,w0)
w - w0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0,z0) + (y, y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0,z0) + )z - z0)∂f/∂z(x0,y0,z0)
(hyperplane in four dimensional space, that can be considered an analog to a plane in three dimentional space)

example:
find the equation of the tangent hyperplane to the hypersurface w = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xyz at (1,-1,1,5)
same process as before, first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xyz) = 2x - 2yz
∂f/∂y(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xyz) = 2y - 2xz
∂f/∂z(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xyz) = 2z - 2xy
substitute
∂f/∂x(1,-1,1) = 2(1) - 2(-1)(1) = 4
∂f/∂y(1,-1,1) = 2(-1) - 2(1)(1) = -4
∂f/∂z(1,-1,1) = 2(1) - 2(1)(-1) = 4
tangent of a hyperplane
w - 5 = (x - 1)∂f/∂x(1,-1,1) + (y + 1)∂f/∂y(1,-1,1) + (z - 1)∂f/∂z(1,-1,1)
w - 5 = 4(x - 1) - 4(y + 1) + 4(z - 1)
w - 5 = 4x - 4y + 4z - 12
-4x + 4y - 4z + w + 7 = 0
4x - 4y + 4z - w - 7 = 0

example:
find equation of the tangent hyperplane to the hypersurface w = e^x + e^y - e^z at (1,1,1,e)
∂f/∂x(e^x + e^y - e^z) = e^x = e^(1) = e
∂f/∂y(e^x + e^y - e^z) = e^y = e^(1) = e
∂f/∂z(e^x + e^y - e^z) = -e^z = -e^(1) = -e
tangent of a hyperplane
w - e = ex - e + ey - e - ez + e
-ex - ey + ez + w = 0
ex + ey - ez - w = 0

example:
find the equation of the tangent hyperplane to the hypersurface w = x^2 - y^2 + xyz at (1,1,1,1)
∂f/∂x(x^2 - y^2 + xyz) = 2x + yz
∂f/∂y(x^2 - y^2 + xyz) = -2y + xz
∂f/∂z(x^2 - y^2 + xyz) = xy
∂f/∂x = 2(1) + (1)(1) = 3
∂f/∂y = -2(1) + (1)(1) = -1
∂f/∂z = (1)(1) = 1
tangent of a hyperplane
w - 1 = 3(x - 1) - 1(y - 1) + 1(z - 1)
w - 1 = 3x - 3 - y + 1 + z - 1
-3x + y - z + w + 2 = 0
3x - y + z - w - 2 = 0

Finding a normal vector to a surface
We now know the equation of a tangent plane relative to the surface z = f(x,y) at (x0,y0,z0)
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0)
slightly rewriting this
∂f/∂x(x0,y0)*(x - x0) + ∂f/∂y(x0,y0)*(y - y0) + (-1)*(z - z0) = 0
this gives us a normal vector to the tangent plane:
<∂f/∂x(x0,y0), ∂f/∂y(x0,y0), -1>
A normal vector to the tangent plane to the surface is called a normal vector to the surface

Finding points at which tangent planes have particular properties
which points on the surface z = y^2 + xy is the tangent plane horizonal? Iff the normal vector to the tangent plane is vertical.
the cartesian equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = f(x,y) at (x0,y0,z0) on the surface:
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0)
where <∂f/∂x(x0,y0), ∂f/∂y(x0,y0), -1> normal vector to the plane
first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x(y^2 + xy) = y
∂f/∂y(y^2 + xy) = 2y + x
normal vector to the tangent plane:
<y, 2y + x, -1>
now we want to find where this normal vector is vertical, which means that the x and y-components of the vector must be 0
{
	∂f/∂x = 0  =>  { y = 0 }
	∂f/∂y = 0  =>  { 2y + x = 0 }
}
from the first equation we get y = 0, substituting this into the second equation:
2(0) + x = 0  =>  x = 0
substituting x = 0 and y = 0
z = 0^2 + (0)(0) = 0
the point where the tangent plane is horizontal is (0,0,0)

example:
Which points on the surface z = 3xy - ln(y) is the tangent plane perpendicular to the vector v = <3,5,-1>
∂f/∂x(3xy - ln(y)) = 3y
∂f/∂y(3xy - ln(y)) = 3x - 1/y 
c * <3y, 3x - 1/y, -1> = <3,5,-1>
{
	3cy = 3
	3cx - c/y = 5
	-c = -1
}
from third equation we get c = 1 substituting into first:
3(1)y = 3  =>  y = 1
substituting c = 1 and y = 1 into the second equation
3(1)x - 1/1 = 5  =>  x = 2
substituting x = 2 and y = 1 into the function
z = 3(2)(1) - ln(1)
= 6
tangent plane is perpendicular to the vector v at (2,1,6)

example:
at which points on the surface z = ln(1 + x^2 + y^2) is the tangent plane horizontal?
∂f/∂x(ln(1 + x^2 + y^2)) = 2x/(1 + x^2 + y^2)
∂f/∂y(ln(1 + x^2 + y^2)) = 2y/(1 + x^2 + y^2)
<2x/(1 + x^2 + y^2), 2y/(1 + x^2 + y^2), -1>
tangent plane is horizontal iff the normal vector is vertical. This means the x and y-components of the vector must be 0
{
	∂f/∂x = 0  =>  2x/(1 + x^2 + y^2) = 0
	∂f/∂y = 0  =>  2y/(1 + x^2 + y^2) = 0
}
first equation x = 0, second y = 0
substituting into our function:
z = ln(1 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 0
tangent plane is horizontal is (0,0,0)

Differentiability of single variable functions in terms of tangent lines
A function f(x) is differentiable at x = x0 with derivative f'(x0) iff the limit exists:
f'(x0) = lim_x->x0 (f(x) - f(x0))/(x - x0)
rewrite the limit:
lim_x->x0 (f(x) - f(x0) - (x - x0)f'(x0))/(x - x0) = 0
for the limit to hold true, the numerator must approach zero
f(x) - f(x0) - (x - x0)f'(x0) ~= 0
can be rewritten as
f(x) - f(x0) ~= (x - x0)f'(x0)
corresponds to the equation of the tangent line at x0
y - y0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0)
We can say that a function f(x) is differentiable at x0 if the function has a unique tangent line at x0

The differentiability of multivariable functions in terms of tangent planes
assume that f(x,y) is a differentiable function of two variables. Since f(x,y) is differentiable at (x0,y0) then there exists a vector ∇f = <f1,f2> 
lim_(x,y)->(x0,y0)
(f(x,y) - f(x0,y0) - <x - x0,y - y0> * <f1, f2>)/(||<x - x0,y - y0>||) = 0

For the above limit to hold, the numerator must approach zero.
Near (x0,y0)
f(x,y) - f(x0,y0) - <x - x0, y - y0> * <f1,f2> ~= 0
can be rewritten
f(x,y) - f(x0,y0) ~= <x - x0, y - y0> * <f1,f2>
exanding the dot product
f(x,y) ~= f(x0,y0) + (x - x0)*f1 + (y - y0) * f2

we need to show that f1 and f2 are the partial derivatives
let y = y0 in the first equation
lim_x->x0 (f(x,y0) - f(x0,y0) - (x - x0)f1)/(x1 - x0) = 0
which is the definition of partial derivative respect to x
f1 = ∂f/∂x(x0,y0)
let x = x0 gives f2 = ∂f/∂y(x0,y0)

the function f(x,y) can be linearized as
f(x,y) ~= f(x0,y0) + (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0,y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0,y0) 
by setting z = f(x,y) and z0 = f(x0,y0) we get equation of the tangent plane:
z - z0 = (x - x0)∂f/∂x(x0, y0) + (y - y0)∂f/∂y(x0, y0)

f(x,y) is differentiable at (x0,y0) if the function has a unique tangent plane at (x0, y0)

∇f = <∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y>
the vector ∇f is known as the gradient vector

===================================================

The chain rule for a single variable functions f = f(x) and x = x(t) states
df/dt = df/dx * dx/dt
f = f(x,y) where x = x(t) and y = y(t) are single-variable functions. How do we find df/dt?

The functions x(t) and y(t) are known as intermediate variabels. They are independent variables for the function f(x,y) but are themselves dependent on the variable t

One way to consider how f(x,y) depends on t is to draw a tree diagram. Starting with f(x,y) we draw a branch for each intermediate variable. Then, we draw a abranch for both x = x(t) and y = y(t) which are both dependent on the variable t
        
         ___x(t)--->t
        /
f(x,y)--
        \___y(t)--->t

The label on each branch will be the derivative describing how the function changes due to a change in the variable.
          
          ___x(t)--dx/dt-->t
    ∂f/∂x/
        /
f(x,y)--
        \
    ∂f/∂y\___y(t)--dy/dt-->t

traversing each branch, we compute the product of the derivatives along each branch and place the reult at the end of the branch.

          ___x(t)--dx/dt-->∂f/∂x * dx/dt
    ∂f/∂x/
        /
f(x,y)--
        \
    ∂f/∂y\___y(t)--dy/dt-->∂f/∂y * dy/dt


Finally to find df/dt we sum the results for each branch:
df/dt = ∂f/∂x * dx/dt + ∂f/∂y * dy/dt
This is called the multivariable chain rule.

Calculating the derivative of a multivariable function with one independent variable
f(x,y) = cos(xy), x = t, and y = e^t, compute df/dt
first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x = -ysin(xy)
∂f/∂y = -xsin(xy)
in terms of t
∂f/∂x = -e^tsin(te^t)
∂f/∂y = -tsin(te^t)
the derivatives of x and y with respect to t
dx/dt = 1, dy/dt = e^t
substituting all derivatives into the multivariable chain rule:
df/dt = ∂f/∂x * dx/dt + ∂f/∂y * dy/dt
[-e^tsin(te^t)] * 1 + [-tsin(te^t)] * e^t
= -e^tsin(te^t) - te^tsin(te^t)
= -(1 + t)e^tsin(te^t)

example:
f(x,y) = ln(xy^2), x = cos(t) and y = sin(t)
compute df/dt for 0 < t < pi/2
first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x = 1/x
∂f/∂y = 2/y
in terms of t
∂f/∂x = 1/cos(t)
∂f/∂y = 2/sin(t)
the derivatives of x and y with respect to t
dx/dt = -sin(t), dy/dt = cos(t)
substituting
df/dt = ∂f/∂x * dx/dt + ∂f/∂y * dy/dt
[1/cos(t)] * -sin(t) + [2/sin(t)] * cos(t)
= -sin(t)/cos(t) + 2 * cos(t)/sin(t)
= 2cot(t) - tan(t)

example:
f(x,y) = xe^(xy), x = t^2, and y = t compute df/dt
first partial derivatives
∂f/∂x = e^(xy) + xye^(xy)
∂f/∂y = x^2e^(xy)
in terms of t
∂f/∂x = e^((t^2)(t)) + (t^2)(t)e^((t^2)(t))
(early simplify)
= e^t^3 + t^3e^t^3
= (1 + t^3)e^t^3
∂f/∂y = (t^2)^2e^((t^2)(t))
= t^4e^t^3
the derivatives of x and y with respect to t
dx/dt = 2t, dy/dt = 1
substituting
df/dt = ∂f/∂x * dx/dt + ∂f/∂y * dy/dt
[(1 + t^3)e^t^3] * 2t + [t^4e^t^3] * 1
= (2t + 2t^4)e^t^3 + t^4e^t^3
= (2t + 3t^4)e^t^3

Special case of the multivariable chain rule
there is a special case of the multivariable chain rule when f = f(x,y) and y = g(x)
x is an independent variable, the chain rule becomes
df/dx = ∂f/∂x * dx/dx + ∂f/∂y * dy/dx
dx/dx is just 1
= ∂f/∂x + ∂f/∂y * dy/dx

Derivative of a multivariable function with one independent variable in the special case
f(x,y) = 2sqrt(x + y) and y = cos(x) compute df/dx
in the case where y = y(x) can be expressed as
df/dx = ∂f/∂x + ∂f/∂y * dy/dx
partial derivative of f with respect to x and y
∂f/∂x = 1/sqrt(x + y), ∂f/∂y = 1/sqrt(x + y)
in terms of x
∂f/∂x = ∂f/∂y = 1/sqrt(x + cos(x))
take the derivative y with respect to x
dy/dx = -sin(x)
all derivatives into multivariable chain rule
df/dx = 1/sqrt(x + cos(x)) + 1/sqrt(x + cos(x)) * (-sin(x))
= 1/sqrt(x + cos(x)) - sin(x)/sqrt(x + cos(x))
= 1 - sin(x)/sqrt(x + cos(x))

example:
f(x,y) = xln(x + y) and y = x^2 compute df/dx
∂f/∂x = ln(x + y) + x/(x + y)
∂f/∂y = x/(x + y)
dy/dx = 2x
df/dx = ln(x + x^2) + x/(x + x^2) + x/(x + x^2) * 2x
= ln(x + x^2) + x + 2x^2/(x + x^2)
= ln(x + x^2) + x(1 + 2x)/x(1 + x)
= ln(x + x^2) + (1 + 2x)/(1 + x)

example:
f(x,y) = sin(x^2 + y) and y = x^2 compute df/dx
∂f/∂x = 2xcos(x^2 + x^2) = 2xcos(2x^2)
∂f/∂y = cos(x^2 + x^2) = cos(2x^2)
dy/dx = 2x
df/dx = 2xcos(2x^2) + cos(2x^2) * 2x
= 2xcos(2x^2) + 2xcos(2x^2)
= 4xcos(2x^2)

Applying the multivariable chain rule if the intermediate variables are also dependent on two variables?
f = f(x,y), x = g(s,t), y = h(s,t)
how do we compute ∂f/∂s
					      /----s ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂s
                    ∂x/∂s/
          ___x(s,t)----- \
    ∂f/∂x/           ∂x/∂t\----t ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂t
        /

                   ∂y/∂t\
                         \----t ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂t
∂f/∂s is all the paths with s as the leaf node from the root.

If we keep t fixed and differentiate f with respect to s, according to the chain rule for two intermediate variables and one independent variable.
∂f/∂s = ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂s + ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂s

The same process would also go for ∂f/∂t (start with root node and follow all paths to t)
∂f/∂t = ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂t + ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂t

calculating the derivative of a multivariable function with two independent variables
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, x = scos(t) and y = tsin(s) calculate ∂f/∂t
two independent variables s and t where x = x(s,t) and y = y(s,t)
∂f/∂t = ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂t + ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂t
∂f/∂x = 2x
∂f/∂y = 2y
in terms of s and t
∂f/∂x = 2scos(t)
∂f/∂y = 2tsin(s)
derivatives of x and y with resepct to t
∂x/∂t = -ssin(t)

= (2scos(t))(-ssin(t)) + (2tsin(s))(sin(s))
= -2s^2sin(t)cos(t) + 2tsin^2(s)
= 2tsin^2(s) - 2s^2sin(t)cos(t)
= 2tsin^2(s) - s^2sin(2t)

∂f/∂x = 2 + te^s
∂f/∂y = se^s

∂x/∂t = 0
∂y/∂t = e^s
substituting
∂f/∂t = ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂t + ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂t
= (2 + te^s)(0) + (se^s)(e^s)
= se^(2s)

example:

= (4st)(2t) + (-4)(2st)
= 8st^2 - 8st
= 8st(t - 1)

= (s - t - s - t)e^(-t^2)
= -2te^(-t^2)

substituting all derivatives into the mutlivariable chain rule
∂f/∂t = (2st + 2s + 6t) * s + (2st) * 3 + (6t - 12s) * (-1)
= 2s^2t + 2s^2 + 6st + 6st - 6t + 12s
= 2s^2t + 2s^2 + 12st + 12s - 6t
= 2(s^2t + s^2 + 6st + 6s - 3t)
c1 = c2 = 6, c3 = -3

Finding a tangent Vector
find a tagent vector to the curve r(t) = ti + t^2j + t^3k
at the point P(1,1,1)
P(1,1,1) is at the tip of r(t) for some specific value t0 of the parameter t. At this point the vector r'(t0) is tangent to the curve.
First, find the value of t that corresponds to P
r(t) = i + j + k
ti + t^2j + t^3k = i + j + k
equating the coefficients of i,j, and k yeilds the system:
{
	t = 1
	t^2 = 1
	t^3 = 1
}
from the first equation we get t = 1. This value also satisfires the other two equations. P(1,1,1) is at the tip of the vector r(1)
Now we calculate r'(t) and evaluate it at t = 1
r'(t) = d/dt(t)i + d/dt(t^2)j + d/dt(t^3)k
= i + 2tj + 3t^2k
r'(1) = i + 2(1)j + 3(1)^2k
= i + 2j + 3k
A tagent vector to the given curve at the point P(1,1,1) is i + 2j + 3k

example:
find a tangent vector to the curve
r(t) = 2ti + (1 + t^2)j + t^3k at P(2,2,1)
2ti + (1 + t^2)j + t^3k = 2i + 2j + k
equating the coefficients of i,j, and k yeilds the system:
{
	2t = 2
	1 + t^2 = 2
	t^3 = 1
}
from the first equation we get t = 1. This value also satisfies the other two equations. P(2,2,1) is at the tip of the vector r(1)
We calculate r'(t) and evaluate at t = 1
r'(t) = d/dt(2t)i + d/dt(1 + t^2)j + d/dt(t^3)k
= 2i + 2tj + 3t^2k
r'(1) = 2i + 2(1)j + 3(1)^2k
= 2i + 2j + 3k

example:
find a vector that's tangent to the curve
r(t) = <2(t - sin(t)), 2(t - cos(t))> at point where t = pi
r'(pi) is tagent to the curve
r'(t) = <2(1 - cos(t)), 2(1 + sin(t))>
r'(pi) = <2(1 - cos(pi)), 2(1 + sin(pi))>
= <2(1 - (-1)), 2(1 + 0)>
= <4, 2>
A tangent vector to curve at the point where t = pi is <4,2>

Finding a tangent line to a curve
find a parametrization of the tangent line to the curve r(t) = <cos(t), sin(t), 4t^2> at the point where t = pi/2
let P be the point at the tip of the vector r(pi/2), at this point the vector r'(pi/2) is tangent to the curve, so the tangent line to the curve at P can be parametrized as
R(u) = r(pi/2) + ur'(pi/2), u ∈ (-∞,∞)
first we find r(pi/2)
r(pi/2) = <cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2), 4(pi/2)^2> = <0,1,pi^2>
now r'(t) at t = pi/2
r'(pi/2) = <d/dt(cos(t)), d/dt(sin(t)), d/dt(4t^2)>
= <-sin(t), cos(t), 8t>
r'(pi/2) <-sin(pi/2), cos(pi/2), 8(pi/2)>
= <-1,0,4pi>
The tangent line to the given curve at the point P where t = pi/2
R(u) = <0,1,pi^2> + u<-1,0,4pi>, u ∈ (-∞,∞)

example:
which of the following gives the equation of the tangent to the curve r(t) = <t^2 - 1, arctan(t)> at point t = 0
r(0) = <(0)^2 - 1, arctan(0)> = <-1, 0>
r'(0) = <d/dt(t^2 - 1), d/dt(arctan(t))>
r'(0) = <2(0), 1/(1 + (0)^2)>
= <0, 1>
R(u) = <-1, 0> + u<0, 1>, u ∈ (-∞,∞)

example:
which of the following gives the equation of the tangent to the curve r(t) <e^t - 1, e^(-2t)> at P(0,1)
r(t) = <0,1>
<e^t - 1, e^(-2t)> = <0,1>
{
	e^t - 1 = 0
	e^(-2t) = 1
}
the first equation we get t = 0 this value satisfies the other equation, P(0,1) is at the tip of the vector r(0)
calculate r'(t)
<d/dt(e^t - 1), d/dt(e^(-2t))>
= <e^t, -2e^(-2t)>
evaluate r'(t) at t = 0
r'(0) = <e^0, -2e^0>
= <1, -2>
tangent line to the curve at P(0,1)
R(u) = <0,1> + u<1, -2>, u ∈ (-∞,∞)

Finding points where a tangent vector is perpendicular to another vector
curve r(t) = <t^2 + 1, 6t + 3> find all the points at which the tangent to the curve is perpendicular to the vector <3,1>
r'(t) = <d/dt(t^2 + 1), d/dt(6t + 3)>
= <2t, 6>
the vectors <3,1> and r'(t) are perpendicular for some value of the parameter t iff <3,1> * r'(t) = 0
<3,1> * r'(t) = 0
<3,1> * <2t, 6> = 0
3 * 2t + 1 * 6 = 0
6t + 6 = 0
t = -1
the only solution is t = -1
r(-1) = <(-1)^2 + 1, 6(-1) + 3> = <2, -3>
<3,1> and r'(t) are perpendicular at (2,-3)

example:
curve r(t) = <e^t, sqrt(1 + t^2)>, find all points which the tangent to the curve is perpendicular to vector <0,1>
r'(t) = <d/dt(e^t), d/dt(sqrt(1 + t^2))>
= <e^t, t/sqrt(1 + t^2)>
<0,1> * r'(t) = 0
<0,1> * <e^t, t/sqrt(1 + t^2)> = 0
0 * e^t + 1 * t/sqrt(1 + t^2) = 0
t/sqrt(1 + t^2) = 0
t = 0
only solution t = 0
r(0) = <e^0, sqrt(1 + 0^2)> = <1,1>
<0,1> and r'(t) are perpendicular at (1,1)

example:
curve r(t) = ti + (1 + 1/2(t^2))j find all points which r'(t) and r(t) are perpendicular
r'(t) = d/dt(t)i, d/dt(1 + 1/2(t^2))j
= i + tj
r(t) and r'(t) are perpendicular if r(t)*r'(t) = 0
r(t) * r'(t) = 0
[ti + (1 + 1/2(t^2))j] * (i + tj) = 0
t * 1 + (1 + 1/2(t^2)) * t = 0
2t + 1/2t^3 = 0
t(4 + t^2) = 0
the only solution is t = 0 since 4 + t^2 > 0 for any t
r(0) = 0i + (1 + 1/2(0)^2)j = j
r(t) and r'(t) are perpendicular at (0,1)

finding points where a tangent vector is parallel to another vector
curve r(t) = (t^2 + t)i + (t^2 - t)j at vector (3i + j)
first derivative of r(t)
r'(t) = d/dt(t^2 + t)i + d/dt(t^2 - t)j
= (2t + 1)i + (2t - 1)j
vectors r'(t) and 3i + j are parallel for some value of the parameter t iff there exists a constant c that r'(t) = c(3i + j)
(2t + 1)i + (2t - 1)j = c(3i + j)
equating the coeffecients of i,j,k gives the system:
{
	2t + 1 = 3c
	2t - 1 = c
}
substituting second equation into first:
2t + 1 = 3c
2t + 1 = 3(2t - 1)
2t + 1 = 6t - 3
6t - 2t = 1 + 3
4t = 4
t = 1
r' and 3i + j are parallel only at the point t = 1
r(1) = (1^2 + 1)i + (1^2 - 1)j = 2i
r'(t) and 3i + j are parallel at point (2,0)

example:
curve r(t) = <2t^2 - t, 5 - 3t^2> find the point which the tangent to the curve is parallel to the vector <-1,2>
r'(t) = d/dt(2t^2 - t) + d/dt(5 - 3t^2)
= <4t - 1, -6t>
r'(t) = c<-1,2>
<4t - 1, -6t> = c<-1,2>
<4t - 1, -6t> = <-c,2c>
{
	4t - 1 = -c
	-6t = 2c
}
first equation c = -4t + 1 substitute into second
-6t = 2(-4t + 1)
-6t = -8t + 2
2t = 2
t = 1
<-1,2> and r' are parallel only at the point t = 1
r(1) = <2(1)^2 - 1, 5 - 3(1)^2> = <1,2>
<-1,2> and r'(t) are parallel at point (1,2)

example:
curve r(t) = <2t^2, e^t, 2e^t> find all points at which r'(t) and r(t) that are parallel
r'(t) = d/dt(2t^2) + d/dt(e^t) + d/dt(2e^t)
= <4t, e^t, 2e^t>
r(t) = cr'(t)
<2t^2, e^t, 2e^t> = c<4t, e^t, 2e^t>
<2t^2, e^t, 2e^t> = <4ct, ce^t, 2ce^t>
{
	2t^2 = 4ct
	e^t = ce^t
	2e^t = 2ce^t
}
from the second and third c = 1 substitute into first:
2t^2 = 4(1)t
t^2 = 2t
t - 2t = 0
t(t - 2) = 0
r and r' are parallel only at points t = 0 and 2
r(0) = <2(0)^2, e^0, 2e^0>
= <0,1,2>
r(2) = <2(2)^2, e^2, 2e^2>
= <8, e^2, 2e^2>
r(t) and r'(t) are parallel at (0,1,2) and (8,e^2,2e^2)

The gradient of a multivariable function is analogous to the derivative of a single-variable function.

For a function f(x,y) whose partial derivatives exist and are continuous at a point (x,y) the gradient vector is denoted ∇f(x,y) can be found by computing the vector of partial derivatives.
∇f(x,y) = ∂f/∂xi + ∂f/∂yj

Calculating the gradient of a function of two variables
find ∇f(x,y) at (1,pi) given that f(x,y) = (x - y)cos(y)

f_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x((x - y)cos(y))
= cos(y)
f_y(x,y) = ∂/∂y((x - y)cos(y))
= -cos(y) - (x - y)sin(y)
∇f(x,y) = f_x(x,y)i + f_y(x,y)j
= cos(y)i - (cos(y) + (x - y)sin(y))j
to find the gradient at the specified point, we substitute (x,y) = (1,pi)
∇f(1,pi) = f_x(1,pi)i + f_y(1,pi)j
= cos(pi)i - (cos(pi) + (1 - pi)sin(pi))j
= -i + j

example:

h_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x(4x^2 - 3xy + 2y^2 + y)
= 8x - 3y
h_y(x,y) = ∂/∂y(4x^2 - 3xy + 2y^2 + y)
= -3x + 4y + 1
∇h(2,3) = (8(2) - 3(3))i + (-3(2) + 4(3) + 1)j
= (16 - 9)i + (-6 + 12 + 1)j
= 7i + 7j

example:
f(x,y) = (3x + 2y)/(x - y) find ∇f(x,y)
partial derivatives
f_x(x,y) = ∂/∂x((3x + 2y)/(x - y))
= 3 * (x - y) - (3x + 2y) * 1
= -5y/(x - y)^2
f_y(x,y) = ∂/∂y((3x + 2y)/(x - y))
= 2(x - y) - (3x + 2y) * -1
= 2x - 2y + 3x + 2y
= 5x/(x - y)^2
∇f(x,y) = f_x(x,y)i + f_y(x,y)j
= (-5y/(x - y)^2)i + (5x/(x - y)^2)j
= -5/(x - y)^2(yi - xj)

The gradient of a function of more than two variables
For a function of three variables f(x,y,z), the gradient of f is given by the vector:
∇f(x,y,z) = f_x(x,y,z)i + f_y(x,y,z)j + f_z(x,y,z)k
For a function f(x1,x2,...,xn) of n variables, its gradient is usually given a column vector:
∇f(x1,x2,...,xn) = [
	fx1
	fx2
	 .
	 .
	 .
	fxn
]

∇g(x,y,z) = g_x(x,y,z)i + g_y(x,y,z)j + g_z(x,y,z)k
= (2x + yz)i + (xz)j + (xy)k
∇g(2,-1,3) = (2(2) + (-1)(3))i + 2(3)j + 2(-1)k
= i + 6j - 2k

example:

f_z(x,y,z) = ∂/∂z(sqrt(xyz))
= sqrt(xyz)/2z
∇f(x,y,z) = (sqrt(xyz)/2x)i + (sqrt(xyz)/2y)j + (sqrt(xyz)/2z)k
= sqrt(xyz)/2((1/x)i + (1/y)j + (1/z)k)

example:
∇g(x,y,z) given g(x,y,z) = sqrt(x + 2) + ln(sqrt(yz))
g_x(x,y,z) = ∂/∂x(sqrt(x + 2) + ln(sqrt(yz)))
= 1/2sqrt(x + 2)
g_y(x,y,z) = ∂/∂y(sqrt(x + 2) + ln(sqrt(yz)))
= 1/2y
g_z(x,y,z) = ∂/∂z(sqrt(x + 2) + ln(sqrt(yz)))
= 1/2z
∇g(x,y,z) = (1/2sqrt(x + 2))i + (1/2y)j + (1/2z)k

finding points where a gradient vanishes
f(x,y) = (y - 4)ln(x - 2) find points (x,y) where ∇f(x,y) = 0
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x((y - 4)ln(x - 2))
= (y - 4)/(x - 2)
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y((y - 4)ln(x - 2))
= ln(x - 2)
∇f(x,y) = (y - 4)/(x - 2)i + ln(x - 2)j
solve ∇f(x,y) = 0
(y - 4)/(x - 2)i + ln(x - 2)j = 0i + 0j
by equating the coefficients of i and j we obtain
{
	(y - 4)/(x - 2) = 0
	ln(x - 2) = 0
}
from first equation, we get y - 4 = 0 which means y = 4 from the second equation means that x = 3
∇f(x,y) = 0 at (3,4)

example:
h(x,y,z) = xy + xy^2 + z^3, find points (x,y,z) where ∇h(x,y,z) = 0
∂h/∂x = ∂/∂x(xy + xy^2 + z^3)
= y + y^2 = y(1 + y)
∂h/∂y = ∂/∂y(xy + xy^2 + z^3)
= x + 2yx
∂h/∂z = ∂/∂z(xy + xy^2 + z^3)
= 3z^2
∇h(x,y,z) = y(1 + y)i + (x + 2yx)j + (3z^2)k
{
	y(1 + y) = 0
	x + 2yx = 0
	3z^2 = 0
}
from first equation y = -1 or 0 substituting
x + 2(-1)x = 0
x = 0
x + 2(0)x = 0
x = 0
third the only way to get 0 is if z is 0
∇h(x,y,z) = 0 at two points: (0,0,0) and (0,-1,0)

example:
f(x,y) = 3x^2 + y^2 - x, find the points (x,y) where ∇f(x,y) = 0
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(3x^2 + y^2 - x)
= 6x - 1
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(3x^2 + y^2 - x)
= 2y
∇f(x,y) = (6x - 1)i + (2y)j
{
	6x - 1 = 0
	2y = 0
}
from first equation x = 1/6, second can only be y = 0
∇f(x,y) = 0 at (1/6, 0)

The gradient of a function is made up of partial derivatives, we can expect it to have properties that are similar to partial derivatives.

f and g are function whose first-order partial derivatives exist and are continuous on some open domain, and that a, b, and x are real constants.
The gradient has the following properties:
Constant rule: ∇c = 0
Linearity: ∇(af + bg) = a∇f + b∇g
product rule: ∇(fg) = g∇f + f∇g
quotient rule: ∇(f/g) = (g∇f - f∇g)/g^2

Calculating the gradient using the properties of the gradient
find the gradient of the product f(x,y)g(x,y) given
f(x,y) = xy,       ∇f(x,y) = yi + xj
g(x,y) = sqrt(xy), ∇g(x,y) = (sqrt(xy)/2x)i + (sqrt(xy)/2y)j
The gradient of the product of two function f(x,y) and g(x,y)
∇[fg] = g∇f + f∇g
using the product rule
∇[f(x,y)g(x,y)] = g(x,y)∇f(x,y) + f(x,y)∇g(x,y)
= sqrt(xy)(yi + xj) + xy((sqrt(xy)/2x)i + (sqrt(xy)/2y)j)
= sqrt(xy)(yi + xj) + sqrt(xy)/2(yi + xj)
sqrt(xy) + sqrt(xy)/2 = 2sqrt(xy)/2 + sqrt(xy)/2 = 3sqrt(xy)/2
= 3sqrt(xy)/2(yi + xj)

example:
what is the gradient of the product f(x,y)g(x,y)
f(x,y) = ln(x)ln(y), g(x,y) = x^2y^2
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(ln(x)ln(y))
= ln(y)/x
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(ln(x)ln(y))
= ln(x)/y
∂g/∂x = ∂/∂x(x^2y^2)
= 2xy^2
∂g/∂y = ∂/∂y(x^2y^2)
= 2x^2y
∇f(x,y) = (ln(y)/x)i + (ln(x)/y)j
∇g(x,y) = (2xy^2)i + (2x^2y)j
∇[f(x,y)g(x,y)] = g(x,y)∇f(x,y) + f(x,y)∇g(x,y)
= (x^2y^2)((ln(y)/x)i + (ln(x)/y)j) + (ln(x)ln(y))((2xy^2)i + (2yx^2)j)
= (2xy^2ln(x)ln(y))i + (2yx^2ln(x)ln(y))j + (xy^2ln(y))i + (x^2yln(x))j
= (2xy^2ln(x)ln(y) + xy^2ln(y))i + (2yx^2ln(x)ln(y) + x^2yln(x))j
= xy^2ln(y)(2ln(x) + 1)i + x^2yln(x)(2ln(y) + 1)j

example:
find the gradient of the product g(x,y)h(x,y) given:
g(x,y) = 3x^2 - 4y, ∇g(x,y) = (6x)i - (4)j
h(x,y) = 2x^2y^2,   ∇h(x,y) = (4xy^2)i + (4x^2y)j
∇[g(x,y)h(x,y)] h(x,y)∇g(x,y) + g(x,y)∇h(x,y)
(2x^2y^2)(6x)i - (4)j) + (3x^2 - 4y)((4xy^2)i + (4x^2y)j)
(2x^2y^2 * 6xi - 2x^2y^2 * 4j)
= 12x^3y^2i - 8x^2y^2j
(3x^2 - 4y) * 4xy^2i + (3x^2 - 4y) * 4x^2y
= (12x^3y^2 - 16xy^3)i + (12x^4y - 16x^2y^2)j
(12x^3y^2 + 12x^3y^2 - 16xy^3)i + (-8x^2y^2 + 12x^4y - 16x^2y^2)j
= (24x^3y^2 - 16xy^3)i + (12x^4y - 24x^2y^2)j

For a multivariable function, existence of the gradient implies continuity. More precisely, given a function f(x,y) and a point a, if ∇f(a) exists, then f is continuous at x = a

The gradient ∇f(a) only exits if the partial derivatives ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y both exist and are continuous at x = a
if ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y both exist and are continuous at x = a then f is continuous at x = a
The continuity of the partial derivatives is absolutely crucial in order to imply continuity. The existence of the partial derivatives alone is not enough to imply that the function is continuous at a point.

===================================================

Surface z = f(x,y) and unit vector u = <u1,u2> the directional derivative of f at the point (x0,y0) in the direction of u
f'u(x0,y0) lim_t->0 (f(x0 + tu) - f(x0))/t
The directional derivative of f is the rate of change of the function f in the direction of u
If f is differentiable, we can write f'u in terms of partial derivatives f_x and f_y
f'u(x0,y0) = ∇f(x0,y0) ⋅ u

Lets find the directional derivative of the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 at the point (x0,y0) = (1,2) in the direction of the vector v = i + j
first we find the unit vector u and the direction of v
||v|| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
u = v/||v|| = 1/sqrt(2)(i + j)
now compute the gradient ∇f(x,y) and elvalutate it at (1,2)
∇f(x,y) = ∂/∂x(x^2 + y^2)i + ∂/∂y(x^2 + y^2)j
= 2xi + 2yj
∇f(1,2) = (2 * 1)i + (2 * 2)j
= 2i + 4j
the directional derivative is
f'u(1,2) = ∇f(1,2) ⋅ u
= (2i + 4j)⋅(1/sqrt(2)i + 1/sqrt(2)j)
= (2 * 1 + 4 * 1)/sqrt(2)
= 6/sqrt(2)
= 3sqrt(2)

Calculating a directional derivative
g(x,y) = 3x^2 + 4xy at A(0,1) in the direction towards B(1,4)
the directional derivative g'u(a,b) of a function g(x,y) at the point (a,b) in the direction of the vector v is
g'u(a,b) = ∇g(a,b) ⋅ u
u is a unit vector in the direction of v
first find the direction vector and the corresponding unit vector
AB-> = <1,4> - <0,1>
= <1,3>
u = AB->/||AB->||
= 1/sqrt(1^2 + 3^2)<1,3>
= 1/sqrt(10)<1,3>
next calculate the gradient ∇g(x,y) at A(0,1)
∇g(x,y) = <∂/∂x(3x^2 + 4xy), ∂/∂y(3x^2 + 4xy)>
= <6x + 4y, 4x>
∇g(0,1) = <6*0 + 4*1, 4*0>
= <4,0>
directional derivative is
g'u(0,1) = ∇g(0,1) ⋅ u
= <4,0> ⋅ <1/sqrt(10), 3/sqrt(10)>
= 4/sqrt(10)
= 4sqrt(10)/10
= 2sqrt(10)/5

example:
find directional derivative f(x,y) = (x + y^2)^2 at point A(-1,-2) in the direction towards the point B(2,2)
AB-> = <2,2> - <-1,-2>
= <3,4>
u = 1/sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)<3,4>
= 1/5<3,4>
∇f(x,y) = <∂/∂x((x + y^2)^2), ∂/∂y((x + y^2)^2)>
= <2x + 2y^2, 4xy + 4y^3>
∇f(-1,-2) = <2(-1) + 2(-2)^2, 4(-1)(-2) + 4(-2)^3>
= <-2 + 8, 8 + -32>
= <6, -24>
<6, -24> ⋅ <3/5, 4/5>
18/5 + -96/5
= -78/5

example:
find directional derivative f(x,y) = 2x + y^2 at (0,1) in the direction of the vector v = 5i + 2j
first find unit vector
||v|| = sqrt(5^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(29)
u = 1/sqrt(29)(5i + 2j)
∇f(x,y) = <∂/∂x(2x + y^2), ∂/∂y(2x + y^2)>
= 2i + 2yj
∇f(0,1) = 2i + 2(1)j
(2i + 2j) ⋅ (5/sqrt(29)i + 2/sqrt(29)j)
(2 * 5 + 2 * 2)/sqrt(29)
= 14sqrt(29)/29

Gradient as the direction of maximum increase of a function
from the formula for the directional derivative, we get that if z = f(x,y) is a differentiable function and u is a unit vector
f'u = ∇f ⋅ u
= |∇f||u|cosθ
= |∇f|cosθ
where θ is the angle between the vectors ∇f and u
It follows that f'u is maximimized when θ = 0, f'u is maximized when u and ∇f point in the same direction. max value of f'u is |∇f|

also when f'u reaches its min value -|∇f| when θ = pi that is when ∇f and u point in the opposite directions

theorem:
A differentiable function f increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient and decreases most rapidlu in the opposite direction to that of its gradient.

Finding the direction of max increase or max decrease of a function
what direction does the function f(x,y) = ln(x^2y) decrease most rapidly at (2,1)
f(x,y) decreases most rapidly in the direction opposite to that of its gradient.
We compute -∇f(x,y) and evaluate at (2,1)
-∇f(x,y) = -∂/∂x(ln(x^2y))i - ∂/∂y(ln(x^2y))j
= (-1/x^2y * 2xy)i - (1/x^2y * x^2)j
= (-2/x)i - (1/y)j
-∇f(2,1) = -2/2i - 1/1j
= -i - j
the function decreases most rapidly in the direction of -i - j

example:
What direction does g(x,y,z) = y^2 + sin(2pix + piz) increase most rapidly at (1,1,2)
∇g(x,y,z) = ∂/∂x(y^2 + sin(2pix + piz))i + ∂/∂y(y^2 + sin(2pix + piz))j + ∂/∂z(y^2 + sin(2pix + piz))k
∂/∂x = 2picos(2pix + piz)
∂/∂y = 2y
∂/∂z = picos(2pix + piz)
∇g(1,1,2) = 2picos(2pi(1) + pi(2))i + 2(1)j + picos(2pi(1) + pi(2))k
= 2picos(2pi + 2pi)i + 2j + picos(2pi+ 2pi)k
= 2picos(4pi)i + 2j + picos(4pi)k
= 2pii + 2j + pik
= <2pi, 2, pi>

example:
What direction does f(x,y) = cos(x) + x^2y increase most rapidly at (1,1) 
∇f(x,y) = ∂/∂x(cos(x) + x^2y)i + ∂/∂y(cos(x) + x^2y)j
∂/∂x = -sin(x) + 2xy
∂/∂y = x^2
∇f(1,1) = (-sin(1) + 2)i + 1j
= (-sin(1) + 2)i + j
(2 - sin(1))i + j

The directional derivative as a generalization of the partial derivative
for a surface z = f(x,y), the partial derivative f_x(x0,y0) gives us the rate of change of f in the direction of the vector i = <1,0> but this is just a special case of the directional derivative
f'i(x0,y0) = ∇(x0,y0) ⋅ <1,0>
= <f_x(x0,y0),f_y(x0,y0)> ⋅ <1,0>
= f_x(x0,y0)
f'j(x0,y0) = ∇(x0,y0) ⋅ <0,1>
= <f_x(x0,y0),f_y(x0,y0)> ⋅ <0,1>
= f_y(x0,y0)
The directional derivative generalizes the notion of a partial derivative
Partial derivative f_x and f_y represent the rate of change of f in the direction of vectors i and j.

theorem:
The directional derivative f'u(x0, y0) represents the rate of change of the function f(x,y) at the point (x0,y0) in the direction of u

The rate of change in the direction of the gradient
what is the directional derivative of the function f at (x0,y0) in the direction of the gradient?
First we find the unit vector u in the direction of ∇f
u = ∇f(x0,y0)/||∇f(x0,y0)||
directional derivative
f'u(x0,y0) = ∇f(x0,y0) ⋅ ∇f(x0,y0)/||∇f(x0,y0)||
= ||∇f(x0,y0)||^2/||∇f(x0,y0)||
= ||∇f(x0,y0)||

theorem:
The directional derivative in the direction of the gradient equals the norm of the gradient. The norm of the gradient can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function in the direction of the gradient.

finding the rate of change of a function in a given direction
g(x,y) = ln(sqrt(xy^3)) what is the rate of change of g at (1/2,3/2) in the direction in which the function increases most rapidly?
∇g(x,y) at (1/2,3/2)
∇g(x,y) = <∂/∂x(ln(sqrt(xy^3))), ∂/∂y(ln(sqrt(xy^3)))>
= <1/sqrt(xy^3) ⋅ y^3/2sqrt(xy^3), 1/sqrt(xy^3) ⋅ 3xy^2/sqrt(xy^3)>
= <1/2x, 3/2y>
∇g(1/2,3/2) = <1/(2*(1/2)), 3/(2*3/2)>
= <1,1>
rate of change of g(x,y) at (1/2,3/2) in the direction ∇g(1/2,3/2) is given by
||∇g(1/2, 3/2)|| = ||<1,1>||
= sqrt(1^2 + 1^2)
= sqrt(2)

example:
g(x,y) = sin(yln(x)). What is the rate of change of g(x,y) at (e,pi) in the direction in which the function increases most rapidly?
∇g(x,y) = <∂/∂x(sin(yln(x))), ∂/∂y(sin(yln(x)))>
= <cos(yln(x)) * y/x), cos(yln(x))ln(x)>
∇g(e,pi) = <-pi/e, -1>
||∇g(e,pi)|| = <-pi/e, -1>
= sqrt((pi/e)^2 + 1^2)
= sqrt(pi^2/e^2 + e^2/e^2)
= sqrt((pi^2 + e^2)/e^2)
= sqrt(pi^2 + e^2)/e

example:
g(x,y) = x^2/y what is the rate of change of g(x,y) at (2,1) in the direction of the vector v <-1,3>
||v|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)
u = 1/sqrt(10)<-1,3>
∇g(x,y) = <∂/∂x(x^2/y), ∂/∂y(x^2/y)>
= <2x/y, -(x^2/y^2)>
∇g(2,1) = <4, -4>
<4, -4> ⋅ 1/sqrt(10)<-1,3>
= 1/sqrt(10)(4 * (-1) + (-4) * 3)
= -16/sqrt(10)
= -16sqrt(10)/10
= -8sqrt(10)/5

A surface S defined by z = f(x,y) and a point P with coordinates (x0,y0,f(x0,y0)) lies on S. We want a formula for the directional derivative f'u(x0,y0), where u = <u1,u2> is a unit vector.
Geometrically f'u(x0,y0) can be constructed in the following way:
Define a vertical plane II thats parallel to u and passes through P
Define the curve C as the intersection of the surface S and the plane II
The directional derivative f'u is the slope of the tangent to C at P.

The geometric interpretation of f'u is similar to that of the partial derivatives f_x and f_y. The only difference here is that we are not restricting the plane II to be parallel to the coordinate axes.

Since f'u is tangent to C and is in the direction of u at P the vector
v = <u1,u2,f'u> is tangent to our surface S at P

<f_x(x0,y0), f_y(x0,y0), -1> is known to be a normal vector to the surface at P. Since this vector must be perpendicular to v, the dot product of the two vectors must be zero.
<u1,u2,f'u> ⋅ <f_x(x0,y0), f_y(x0,y0), -1> = 0
u1f_x(x0,y0) + u2f_y(x0,y0) - f'u = 0
f'u = ∇f(x0,y0) ⋅ u

Multivariable Chain rule in vector form
f(r) = f(x,y) = xy^2
function takes a vector-valued function
r(t) = <x(t),y(t)> = <cos(t),sin(t)>
as input. How do we calculate d/dt[f(r(t))]
to do this we use the multivariable chain rule in vector form
d/dt[f(r(t))] = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
First we compute ∇f(x,y)
∇f(x,y) = <∂/∂x(f(x,y)), ∂/∂y(f(x,y))>
= <∂/∂x(xy^2), ∂/∂y(xy^2)>
= <y^2,2xy>
substitute x = cos(t) and y = sin(t)
∇f(r(t)) = <(sin(t))^2, 2cos(t)(sin(t))>
= <(sin(t))^2, 2cos(t)sin(t)>
= <sin^2(t), 2sin(t)cos(t)>
r'(t)<d/dt(cos(t)), d/dt(sin(t))>
= <-sin(t), cos(t)>
apply the chain rule
d/dt[f(r(t))] = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
= <sin^2(t), 2sin(t)cos(t)> ⋅ <-sin(t), cos(t)>
-sin^3t + 2sin(t)cos^2(t)

Vector form of the chain rule to a function of two variables
f(x,y) = x^2 + 2y^3 and r(t) = sin(t)i + e^tj compute d/dt[f(r(t))]
chain rule in vector form
d/dt[f(r(t))] = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
first 
∇f(x,y) = ∂/∂x(x^2 + 2y^3)i + ∂/∂y(x^2 + 2y^3)j
= 2xi + 6y^2
substitute r(t)
∇f(r(t)) = 2(sin(t))i + 6(e^t)^2j
derivative of r'(t)
r'(t) = d/dt(sin(t))i + d/dt(e^t)j
= cos(t)i + e^tj
apply chain rule
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
= (2(sin(t))i + 6(e^t)^2j) ⋅ (cos(t)i + e^tj)
= 2sin(t)cos(t) + 6e^(2t) ⋅ e^t
= sin(2t) + 6e^(3t)

example:
f(x,y) = ln(xy), r(t) = cos(t)i + t^2j compute d/dt[f(r(t))]
d/dt[f(r(t))] = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
∇f(x,y) = ∂/∂x(ln(xy))i + ∂/∂y(ln(xy))j
= 1/xi + 1/yj
∇f(r(t)) = 1/cos(t)i + 1/t^2
r'(t) = d/dt(cos(t))i + d/dt(t^2)j
= -sin(t)i + 2tj
chain
(1/cos(t)i + 1/t^2) ⋅ (-sin(t)i + 2tj)
= -sin(t)/cos(t) + 2t/t^2
= 2/t - tan(t)
= 2t - tan(t)i/t^2
= (2 - ttan(t)i)/t
(note the extra t before t is intentional because we are dividing whole equation by t)

example:
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, r(t) = e^ti + e^(-t)j d/dt[f(r(t))]
∇f(x,y) = ∂/∂x(x^2 + y^2)i + ∂/∂y(x^2 + y^2)j
= 2xi + 2yj
∇f(r(t)) = 2(e^t)i + 2e^(-t)j
r'(t) = d/dt(e^t)i + d/dt(e^(-t))j
= e^ti + -1/e^tj
chain
(2(e^t)i + 2e^(-t)j) ⋅ (e^ti + -1/e^tj)
= 2e^(2t) - 2e^(-2t)

Applying the vector form of the chain rule to a function of three variables
f(x,y,z) = xzln(y), r(t) = t^2i + tj + t^3k compute d/dt[f(r(t))]
∇f(x,y,z) = ∂/∂x(xzln(y))i + ∂/∂y(xzln(y))j + ∂/∂z(xzln(y))k
= zln(y)i + xz/yj + xln(y)k
∇f(r(t)) = (t^3)ln(t)i + t^4j + t^2ln(t)k
r'(t) = d/dt(t^2)i + d/dt(t)j + d/dt(t^3)k
= 2ti + j + 3t^2k
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
(t^3ln(t)i + t^4j + t^2ln(t)k) ⋅ (2ti + j + 3t^2k)
= (t^3ln(t)) * 2t + (t^4) * 1 + (t^2ln(t)) * 3t^2
= 2t^4ln(t) + t^4 + 3t^4ln(t)
= t^4(5ln(t) + 1)

example:
f(x,y,z) = z(x + y), r(t) = sin(t)i + cos(t)j + e^tk compute d/dt[f(r(t))]
∇f(x,y,z) =  ∂/∂x(z(x + y))i + ∂/∂y(z(x + y))j + ∂/∂z(z(x + y))k
= zi + zj + (x + y)k
∇f(r(t)) = e^ti + e^tj + (sin(t) + cos(t))k
r'(t) = d/dt(sin(t))i + d/dt(cos(t))j + d/dt(e^t)k
= cos(t)i - sin(t)j + e^tk
(e^ti + e^tj + (sin(t) + cos(t))k) ⋅ (cos(t)i - sin(t)j + e^tk)
= (e^t(cos(t) - sin(t)) + e^t(sin(t) + cos(t)))
= e^t[(cos(t) - sin(t)) + (sin(t) + cos(t))]
= cos(t) - sin(t) + sin(t) + cos(t) = 2cos(t)
= 2e^tcos(t)

example:
f(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz, r(t) = ti + e^tj + ek compute d/dt[f(r(t))]
∇f(x,y,z) =  ∂/∂x(xy + yz + xz)i + ∂/∂y(xy + yz + xz)j + ∂/∂z(xy + yz + xz)k
= (y + z)i + (x + z)j + (y + x)k
∇f(r(t)) = (e^t + e)i + (t + e)j + (e^t + t)k
r'(t) = d/dt(t)i + d/dt(e^t)j + d/dt(e)k
= 1i + e^tj + 0k
((e^t + e)i + (t + e)j + (e^t + t)k) ⋅ (1i + e^tj + 0k)
= (e^t + e) * 1 + (t + e) * e^t + (e^t + t) * 0
= e^t + e + te^t + e^(t+1)
= e^(t+1) + (1 + t)e^t + e

Evaluating the derivative at a point using chain rule
d/dt[f(r(t))] at t = pi given 
∇f(x,y) = (2y - 1)i + (2x - 1)j, r(t) = sin(t)i + cos(t)j
∇f(r(t)) = (2cos(t) - 1)i + (2sin(t) - 1)j
r'(t) = d/dt(sin(t))i + d/dt(cos(t))j
= cos(t)i + (-sin(t))j
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
= ((2cos(t) - 1)i + (2sin(t) - 1)j) ⋅ (cos(t)i + (-sin(t))j)
= (2cos(t) - 1) * cos(t) + (2sin(t) - 1) * (-sin(t))
= 2cos^2(t) - cos(t) - 2sin^2(t) + sin(t)
= 2(cos^2(t) - sin^2(t)) + sin(t) - cos(t)
= 2cos(2t) + sin(t) - cos(t)
t = pi
2cos(2pi) + sin(pi) - cos(pi)
= 2(1) + 0 - (-1)
= 3

(original problem had ∇f(x,y) = sin(y)i + xcos(y) which will result in undefined in the final result changing to sin(y)i + xsin(y) just for this example because there is an error)
example:
d/dt[f(r(t))] at t = pi/2 given:
∇f(x,y) = sin(y)i + xsin(y)j, r(t) = t/2i + tj
∇f(r(t)) = sin(t)i + t/2sin(t)j
r'(t) = d/dt(t/2)i + d/dt(t)j
= 1/2i + 1j
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
(sin(t)i + t/2sin(t)j) ⋅ (1/2i + j)
= sin(t)/2 + t/2sin(t) * 1
= 1/2(t + 1)sin(t)
t = pi/2
= 1/2(pi/2 + 1)sin(pi/2)
= 1/2(pi + 2/2)(1)
= (pi + 2)/4

example:
d/dt[f(r(t))] at t = 1 given:
∇f(x,y) = 2x/(x^2 + 3y)i + 3/(x^2 + 3y)j, r(t) = ti + t^2j
∇f(r(t)) = 2(t)/((t)^2 + 3(t^2))i + 3/((t)^2 + 3(t^2))j
r'(t) = d/dt(t)i + d/dt(t^2)j
= 1 + 2t
(2(t)/((t)^2 + 3(t^2))i + 3/((t)^2 + 3(t^2))j) ⋅ (1 + 2t)
= 2t/4t^2 + 3/4t^2 * 2t
= 1/2t + 6t/4t^2
= 1/2t + 3/2t
= 4/2t
= 2t
= 2(1) = 2

Derivative as rate of change
Consider f(r(t)) as the values taken by the function f along the curve r(t) so the derivative d/dt[f(r(t))] the rate of change of f with respect to t along the curve r(t), if r(t) is a level curve f(x,y) = c, then by chain rule:
f(r(t)) = c
d/dt(f(r(t))) = d/dt(c)
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t) = 0
The gradient vector ∇f is orthogonal to every level curve of f

The rate of change of a multivariable function at a point using the chain rule
f(x,y,z) = x^2 - y^2 - z with respect to t along the curve r(t) = <sin(t), cos(t), t> at the point t = pi/4
the rate of change of f(x,y,z) with respect to t along with the curve r(t) is given by d/dt[f(r(t))] to calculate this we can use the chain rule
The chain rule in vector form
d/dt[f(r(t))] = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
∇f(x,y,z) = <∂/∂x(x^2 - y^2 - z), ∂/∂y(x^2 - y^2 - z), ∂/∂z(x^2 - y^2 - z)>
= <2x, -2y, -1>
substitute x = sin(t), y = cos(t), z = t
∇f(r(t)) = <2sin(t), -2cos(t), -1>
calculate the derivative of r(t)
r'(t) = <d/dt(sin(t)), d/dt(cos(t)), d/dt(t)>
= <cos(t), -sin(t), 1>
apply chain rule
∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)
= <2sin(t), -2cos(t), -1> ⋅ <cos(t), -sin(t), 1>
= 2sin(t) * cos(t) - 2cos(t) * -sin(t) - 1 * 1
= 2sin(t)cos(t) + 2sin(t)cos(t) - 1
= 4sin(t)cos(t) - 1
the rate of change of f along the curve r(t) at t = pi/4
= 4sin(pi/4)cos(pi/4) - 1
= 4 * sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2)/2 - 1
= 1

example:
compute the rate of change of the function
f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 3xyz with respect to t along the curve
r(t) = <t^2, t + 1, -t> at the point t = 1
∇f(x,y,z) = <∂/∂x(x^2 + 3xyz), ∂/∂y(x^2 + 3xyz), ∂/∂z(x^2 + 3xyz)>
= <2x + 3yz, 3xz, 3xy>
∇f(r(t)) = <2(t^2) + 3(t + 1)(-t), 3(t^2)(-t), 3(t^2)(t + 1)>
= <2t^2 - 3t^2 - 3t, -3t^3, 3t^3 + 3t^2>
= <-t^2 - 3t, -3t^3, 3t^3 + 3t^2>
r'(t) = <d/dt(t^2), d/dt(t + 1), d/dt(-t)>
= <2t, 1, -1>
<-t^2 - 3t, -3t^3, 3t^3 + 3t^2> ⋅ <2t, 1, -1>
= (-t^2 - 3t) * 2t + (-3t^3) * 1 + (3t^3 + 3t^2) * (-1)
= -2t^3 - 6t^2 - 3t^3 - 3t^3 - 3t^2
= -8t^3 - 9t^2
substitute even though it is just 1 it will drastically change the results
= -8(1)^3 - 9(1)^2

example:
rate of change f(x,y) = sin(x - y) along the curve
r(t) = <2sqrt(t), 4t> at t = 1
∇f(x,y) = <∂/∂x(sin(x - y)), ∂/∂y(sin(x - y))>
= <cos(x - y), -cos(x - y)>
∇f(r(t)) = <cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t), -cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t)>
r'(t) = <d/dt(2sqrt(t)), d/dt(4t)>
<1/sqrt(t), 4>
<cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t), -cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t)> ⋅ <1/sqrt(t), 4>
= cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t) * 1/sqrt(t) - cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t) * 4
= cos(2sqrt(t) - 4t)(1/sqrt(t) - 4)
t = 1
cos(2sqrt(1) - 4(1))(1/sqrt(1) - 4)
(note cos(-x) = cos(x))
= -3cos(2)
