The law of total probability
three events B1, B2, and B3 exist within a sample space S
B1, B2, and B3 are mutually exculsive and the events cover the entire sample space.
When these two conditions are satisfied, S is the disjoint union of B1, B2, and B3 we write
S = B1 ⊔ B2 ⊔ B3

This is shown below:
|-------------------|S
|       /    \      |
|  B4  /  B2  \ B3  |
|     /        \    |
|    /          \   |
|-------------------|

We now wish to compute the probability of an event A that lies within S, and its intersections with B1, B2, B3
(the inner box is A, outer is S)

|-------------------|S
| ______/____\______| 
| |A∩B1/ A∩B2 \A∩B3|| 
| |__ /________\___||
|    /          \   |
|-------------------|

The law of total probability can be deduced from this diagram, it states that
P(A) = P(A ∩ B1) + P(A ∩ B2) + P(A ∩ B3)
the law of total probability can be extended to arbitrary number of events
P(A) = P(A ∩ B1) + P(A ∩ B2) + ...
= Σ_i P(A ∩ Bi)
where S = B1 ⊔ B2 ⊔ ... is disjoint union of S

A worked example
suppose that a particular garden is divided into three small plots. 10 tulips in the first plot 5 are yellow, 12 tulips in the second plot 6 are yellow and 14 tulips in the third plot 4 are yellow.
Let A be the event that a chosen tulip is yellow
B1 the event that the selected tulip comes from the first plot
B2 " " second plot
B3 " " third plot
disjoint union
B1 ⊔ B2 ⊔ B3
covers the entire sample space, and that there a total of 10+12+14 = 36
to calculate P(A ∩ B1) we take the number of yellow tulips in the first plot (5) and divide by total (36)
P(A ∩ B1) = 5/36
P(A ∩ B2) = 6/36
P(A ∩ B3) = 4/36
the probability that a randomly chosen tulip is yellow
5/36 + 6/36 + 4/36 = 15/36
= 5/12
there is an easier way to solve this problem sum total of yellow tulips (5+6+4=15) and divide by the total number of tulips (10+12+14=36) we have to do it the way that we did to get used to the law of probability because they sometimes aren't intuitive and understanding law of probability will help when things get trickier.

Applying the law of total probability
A store has 40 employees of which 21 are male. The store is divided into three departments A,B, and C, there are 7 male workers in department A, 8 in C what is the probability that a randomly selected store worker is a male that works in department B?
Let M be the event that the chosen worker is a male
A be the event that the selected worker works in department A
B " " department B
C " " department C
the disjoint union covers the entire sample space
A ⊔ B ⊔ C
law of total probability states:
P(F) = P(F ∩ A) + P(F ∩ B) + P(F ∩ C)
we want to find P(F ∩ B)
P(F ∩ A) 7 male workers in dep A by total 7/40
P(F ∩ C) 8/40
we are given P(F) = 21/40
substituting the above info into the law of total probability and solving for P(F ∩ B)
P(F) = P(F ∩ A) + P(F ∩ B) + P(F ∩ C)
21/40 = 7/40 + P(F ∩ B) + 8/40
P(F ∩ B) = 21/40 - 7/40 - 8/40
P(F ∩ B) = 6/40
P(F ∩ B) = 3/20

example:
Melissa has three email accounts, the first account received 16 emails, of which 5 spam. Second account received 10 emails, and 2 were spam. Third account 14 emails 3 were spam. What is the probability that a randomly selected email across all her accounts is spam?
10/40 = 1/4

example:
Mathias has three ranches A,B, and C. There are 100 goats in total across all three ranches. Ranch A has 14 ice cream goats, in ranch B there are 9 ice cream goats. If 35% of all goats are ice cream goats, what is the probability that a randomly selected goat is a ice cream goat from ranch C.
(35% are ice cream goats from the 100 total)
Ranch A 14/100
Ranch B 9/100
Ranch C 12/100
12% is the probability that I would select an ice cream goat from ranch C

Its more helpful to express the law of total probability using conditional probabilities. From the multiplication law for conditional probability:
P(A ∩ B1) = P(A|B1)P(B1)
P(A ∩ B2) = P(A|B2)P(B2)
P(A ∩ B3) = P(A|B3)P(B3)
substituting the above form into the law of total probability
P(A) = P(A|B1)P(B1) + P(A|B2)P(B2) + P(A|B3)P(B3)

example:
Applying the law of total probability in terms of conditional probability
Three factories produce the same spare part for a particular car model. Factory A produces 32% of the overall parts, 1.5% are defective. Factory B produces 33% parts, 2% are defective, factory C produces 35% parts, 1.4% are defective. If one part is selected randomly, what is the probability that is defective?
D be the event that a randomly selected part is defective
A be the event that the selected part was produced by Factory A
B " " Factory B
C " " Factory C
the disjoint union covers the whole sample space
A ⊔ B ⊔ C
The probability that a randomly selected part is defective, we can use the law of total probability
P(D) = P(D ∩ A) + P(D ∩ B) + P(D ∩ C)
= P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B) + P(D|C)P(C)
Factory A produces 32% of the parts, factory B 33%, factory C 35%
P(A) = 0.32, P(B) = 0.33, P(C) = 0.35
1.5% parts from factory A, 2% parts from factory B, 1.4% parts from factory C are defective
P(D|A) = 0.015, P(D|B) = 0.02, P(D|C) = 0.014
subtituting
P(D) = P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B) + P(D|C)P(C)
= (0.015)(0.32) + (0.02)(0.33) + (0.014)(0.35)
= 0.0048 + 0.0066 + 0.0049
= 0.0163
this is the probability of randomly selecting part is defective

example:
Apple manufactures iphones. of the iphones manufactured, 45% are produced by the first machine, 25% are produced by second machine, third machine produces the remaining. If 8% of the iphones produced by the first machine, 4% by second, 5% by third are defective what is the probability that a randomly selected iphone is defective? 
(0.08)(0.45) + (0.04)(0.25) + (0.05)(0.30)
0.036 + 0.01 + 0.015 = 0.061

example:
We have three backpacks containing bananas. The probability of picking a bruised banana from backpack A is 1/6, backpack B is 1/5, backpack C 1/3. A backpack is selected at random and a banana is randomly selected from the backpack. What is the probability that the selected banana is bruised?
backpack is random (3 total)
let N equal the bruised banana event
P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = 1/3
P(N|A) = 1/6, P(N|B) = 1/5, P(N|C) = 1/3
P(N) = P(N|A)P(A) + P(N|B)P(B) + P(N|C)P(C)
= (1/6)(1/3) + (1/5)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3)
= 1/18 + 1/15 + 1/9
= 21/90
= 7/30

finding a conditional probability using the law of total probability
Three bags A,B, and C contains pears. It is known that 2/5 pears in bag A and 1/4 pears in bag B are green. A bag is selected at random, and a pear is randomly chosen from the bag. If the probability that the selected pear is green is 1/3 what proportion of pears from bag C are green?
Let G be the event that the selected pear is green
Let A be the event that the selected pear is from bag A
Let B " " bag B
Let C " " bag C
A ⊔ B ⊔ C
P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = 1/3
2/5 of the pears in bag A and 1/4 of pears in bag B are green
P(G|A) = 2/5, P(G|B) = 1/4
the probability of picking a green pear from any of the three bags is 1/3
P(G) = 1/3
1/3 = (2/5)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) + P(G|C)(1/3)
1/3 = 2/15 + 1/12 + 1/3 * P(G|C)
1/3 * P(G|C) = 1/3 - 2/15 - 1/12
1/3 * P(G|C) = 7/60
P(G|C) = 7/20
7/20 of pears from bag C are green

example:
A science teacher splits her chemistry class into three groups. 35% of all students are in Group A, 35% are in group B, and 30% are in group C. If 20% of the students in Group A obtained the top grade 10% in group B obtained top grade, and the probility that a randomly selected student from any group obtained the top grade is 0.255, what is the probability that a randomly selected student from Group C obtained top grade?
P(A) = 0.35, P(B) = 0.35, P(C) = 0.30
P(T|A) = 0.20, P(T|B) = 0.10
P(G) = 0.255
0.255 = (0.20)(0.35) + (0.10)(0.35) + P(T|C)(0.30)
0.255 = 0.07 + 0.035 + 0.30P(T|C)
0.30P(T|C) = 0.15
P(T|C) = 0.5

At a grocery store 40% of the customers by store brand toilet paper, 45% buy charmen toilet paper and 15% buy quiltern. It is known that 65% of the customers who purchase store brand toilet paper and 50% of customers who buy charmen pay with credit card. If the probability that a randomly selected customer pays with a credit card is 57.5% what percentage of quiltern toilet paper customer pay using a credit card?
.575 = (0.40)(0.65) + (0.45)(0.50) + P(Q|C)(0.15)
.575 = 0.26 + 0.225 + 0.15P(Q|C)
.575 = 0.485 + 0.15P(Q|C)
.575 - 0.485 = 0.15P(Q|C)
0.09 = 0.15P(Q|C)
P(Q|C) = 0.6 = 60%
60% of quilten toilet paper customers pay with credit card

a little confusing for me was what should be on the left of | and on the right.
example: 
If you know a student is in math class and you want to determine their likelihood of being female we use F(F|M)
if you know the student is female and want to determine their likelihood of being in math class use P(M|F)

subtle difference but I think the example helps.

example:
If you have a bag of candies and you know that some candies are red (event R) and some are square (event S), asking:
What’s the chance a square candy is red? P(R|S)
What’s the chance a red candy is square? P(S|R)
what you know versus what you’re trying to find out. Always ask: "Given what?" to determine the correct format.

For two events A and B, Bayes' theorem states that
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
Deriving Bayes' theorem, recall that the multiplication law states that
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) (*)
Swapping A and B in the multiplication law and noting that P(B ∩ A) = P(A ∩ B)
P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B)/P(A)
which can be written as 
P(A ∩ B) = P(B|A)P(A)
substituting the above expression for P(A ∩ B) into (*) gives Bayes' theorem

Computing a conditional probability using bayes' theorem
given that P(K|L) = 0.15, P(K) = 0.6 and P(L) = 0.4 compute P(L|K)
P(L|K) = P(K|L)P(L)/P(K)
= (0.15)(0.4)/0.6
= 0.06/0.6
= 0.1

example:
given P(B|A) = 0.2, P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.4 compute P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (0.2)(0.3)/(0.4) = 0.15

example:
given P(C|A) = 0.6, P(A) = 0.4 and P(C) = 0.3 compute P(A|C)
P(A|C) = (0.6)(0.4)/(0.3) = 0.8

Bayes' theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
("|" given that)
we can rewrite Bayes' theorem in a slightly different way
P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A)/P)B
Bayes' theorem is significant because it allows us to update our belief that a particular hypothesis is true when new evidence comes to light.
Suppose a doctor wishes to asses the probability that a certain patient is infected with a particular disease. It is known that those aged 65 or older have a higher change of carrying a disease.
A = the event that a randomly selected patient has the disease
B = the event that a randomly selected patient is 65 years old or more
P(has disease | patient 65+) = P(has disease) * P(patient 65+ | has disease)/P(patient 65+)
P(has diesease) is called prior. It tells us the probability that a randomly selected patient has disease without considering other factors
P(has diesease | patient 65+) is the likelihood. It tells us the proportion of infected people that are 65 or older. This quantity could be established by taking a random sample from the population of infected people and computing the ratio of those that are 65 or older
Bayes' theorem allows us to update the hypothesis (the paitent has the disease) taking into account information about the patient (they are 65 or older) making use of existing available evidence (an estimate of the proportion of infected people that are 65 or older)
if more evidence is introduced we will further improve the accuracy of the posterior.

Applying Bayes' theorem
Ireland citizens showed that 17% of all males smoke. Overall 27.3% of the population smoke, 51% of the population are male. If a smoker from this population is selected at random, what is the probability of them being male?
Let S be the event that a randomly selected person smokes and let M be the event that they are male, we require P(M|S) we can compute using Bayes' theorem
P(M|S) = P(S|M)P(M)/P(S)
P(S|M) = 0.17, 17% of males smoke
P(M) = 0.51 since 51% of the population are male
P(S) = 0.273 since 27% of population smoke
= (0.17)(0.51)/0.273
= 32% (rounded)

example:
On a particular road, 80% of all vehicles are cars. It its known that 5% of all cars are white and 10% of all vehicles are white. If a white vehicle is selected at random, what is the probability that it is a car?
P(C|W) = P(W|C)P(C)/P(W)
P(W|C) = 0.05, 5% of all cars are white
P(C) = 0.8, since 80% of all vehicles are cars
P(W) = 0.1, 10% of all vehicles are white
= (0.05)(0.8)/0.1

example:
A country showed 90% of all people with a degree speak 2 languages. Overall 63% of the population speaks 2 languages, and 31% of population has a degree. A person who speaks 2 languages is selected at random, what is the probability of them having a degree?
P(D|L) = P(L|D)P(D)/P(L)
= (0.90)(0.31)/0.63
P(L|D) 0.9, 90% of people have a degree speak 2 languages
P(D) 0.31, 31% has degree
P(L) 0.63, 63% speak two languages

Expressing Bayes' theorem in an alternative form using the law of total probability
Bayes' theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
the law of total probability tells us
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A')
substituting into bayes' theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/(P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A'))

Applying Bayes' Theorem with the law of total probability
A bag contains 2 black pretzels and 4 green pretzels, a second bag has 2 black pretzels and 2 green pretzels, a bag is chosen at random and a pretzel is selected from the chosen bag also at random. Given that the selected pretzel is green what is the probability that it came from the second bag?
Let G be the event that the selected pretzel is green and let S be the event that the second bag is chosen, then we requre P(S|G) which we can compute using Bayes' theorem
P(S|G) = P(G|S)P(S)/P(G) = P(G|S)P(S)/P(G|S)P(S) + P(G|S')P(S')
first bag contains 4 green pretzels and 2 black
P(G|S') = 4/4+2 = 2/3
second bag 2 green, 2 black pretzels
P(G|S) = 2/2+2 = 1/2
bags are selected at random
P(S) = P(S') = 1/2
using Bayes' Theorem:
P(G|S)P(S)/P(G|S)P(S) + P(G|S')P(S')
= ((1/2)(1/2))/((1/2)(1/2) + (2/3)(1/2))
= (1/4)/(7/12)
= 6/14
= 3/7

example:
Two identical backpacks contains books. First backpack has 1 math book and 1 science book, the second backpack has 3 math books and 2 science books. A backpack is selected at random, and one book is chosen from the selected backpack also at random. If the selected book is a science book what is the probability that is is from second backpack?
first backpack 1 science and 1 math book
P(S|B') = 1/2
second backpack 3 math, 2 science books
P(S|B) 2/3+2 = 2/5
backback selected at random
P(B) = P(B') = 1/2
P(B|S) = P(S|B)P(B)/P(S|B)P(B) + P(S|B')P(B')
= ((2/5)(1/2))/((2/5)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2))
= (2/10)/(2/10) + (1/4)
= (2/10)/(4/20) + (5/20)
= (2/10)/(9/20)
= 40/90
= 4/9

example:
At a college 10% of males and 15% of females play baseball. If 40% of students in the college are male what is the probability that a randomly chosen baseball player is male? round to 4 decimals
P(B|M) = (randomly chosen a baseball player, hypothesis are they male)
P(M|B)P(M) = (males that play baseball)(total males)
P(M|B')P(B') = (females that play baseball)(total females)
= P(B|M) = P(M|B)P(M)/P(M|B)P(M) + P(M|B')P(B')
= (0.10)(0.40)/(0.10)(0.40) + (0.15)(0.60)
0.04/0.13
~= 0.3077

Accuracy of medical tests
A lab test for a particular disease is conducted on a few patients. 94% patients are infected and 2% are not infected tested positive for disease. 5% of the entire population is infected with the disease. What is the probablity that a randomly chosen patient that tested postive is not infected. round to percent.
D = the event that a randomly chosen patient is infected with the disease
T = the event they tested positive
P(D'|T) = P(T|D')P(D')/P(T) = P(T|D')P(D')/P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D')P(D')
An infected person tests positive is 94%, probability that a non-infected person tests positive is 2%
P(T|D) = 0.94, P(T|D') = 0.02
only 5% of the population has the disease
P(D) = 0.05, P(D') = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95
P(T|D')P(D')/P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D')P(D')
= (0.02)(0.95)/(0.94)(0.05) + (0.02)(0.95)
~= 0.287
~= 29%
when a non-infected patient tests positive for a disease, it is a false postive
when an infected patient tests negative for a disease, it is a false negative.

example:
(the wording messed me up here)
a lab tests for a specific disease, 97% of patients are infected, 1% of those are not infected tested positive for the disease. Only 1% of the entire population is infected with the disease. What is the probability that a randomly chosen patient that tested positive is infected? round to 2 decimals
D chosen patient is infected with disease
T tested postive
P(D|T) = P(T|D)P(D)/P(T) = P(T|D)P(D)/P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D')P(D')
infected person testing positive is 97%, not infected testing positve is 1%
P(T|D) = 0.97, P(T|D') = 0.01
only 1% of population has the disease
P(D) = 0.01, P(D') = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99
= (0.97)(0.01)/(0.97)(0.01) + (0.01)(0.99)
~= 0.49

example:
(same question worded differently)
95% infected, and 2% of those positive for disease. 20% of entire population is infected with the diesease. What is the probability a random chosen patient tested negative is infected
Infected person testing positive: 95%, non-infected 2%
P(T'|D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05,  P(T'|D') = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98
only 20% of population has disease
P(D) = 0.20, P(D') = 0.80
P(D|T') = P('T|D)P(D)/P('T|D)P(D) + P(T'|D')P(D')
(0.05)(0.2)/(0.05)(0.2) + (0.98)(0.8)

if 65% of all customers travel with children and 40% customers with children choose the bus, what is the probability that a randomly chosen customer that chooses the bus travels with children?
Let C be the event that a customer travels with children, B be the event that a customer takes the bus, and I1, I2, I3 be the event that a customer chooses itinerary 1,2, or 3
P(I1) = 0.25, P(B|I1) = 0.6

65% of customers have children

40% of customers with children chose bus
P(B|C) = 0.4
We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen customer that chooses the bus travels with children, which is represented as P(C|B)
Using Bayes' theorem combined with the law of total probability
P(C|B) = P(B|C)P(C)/P(B)
= P(B|C)P(C)/P(B|I1)P(I1) + P(B|I2)P(I2) + P(B|I3)P(I3)
= (0.4)(0.65)/(0.6)(0.25) + (0.3)(0.3) + (0.2)(0.45)
= 0.26/0.33
~= 0.788

P(R|W) = P(W|R)P(R)/P(W|V1)P(V1) + P(W|V2)P(V2) + P(W|V3)P(V3)
0.15 = (0.4)(0.16)/(0.2)(0.36) + (0.06)(0.17) + P(W|V3)(0.47)
0.15 = 0.064/0.0822 + 0.47P(W|V3)
solving for P(W|V3)
0.15(0.0822 + 0.47P(W|V3)) = 0.064
0.0822 + 0.47P(W|V3) = 0.064/0.15

===================================================

A random variable X is a variable whose value is deteremined by the outcome of a trail or experiment. A random variable can take on one of many values from set S called the range or support of X.
A continuous random variable is a random variable whose set of possible values S is given by an interval of real numbers

The height of a randomly selected person could be modeled as a continuous random variable because its possible values from an interval of an interval of real numbers. For modeling purposes we usually assume that the height of a randomly selected person could be any number in the real interval (0, infinity), although we could also restrict this to a finite interval [a,b] if we wanted

The result of rolling 6-sided die is not a continuous random variable because its possible values are 1,2,3,4,5,6, which does not correspond to an interval of real numbers.
physical quantities such as mass, length, area, volume, time, fluid concentration, etc. are usually modeled as continuous variables

Identifying continuous random variables
what is a continuous random variable?
the length of randomly selected baseball field
the weight, in grams, of a slice cut from a cake weighing 1kg
the percent concentation of fruit concentrate in a radomly selected fruit drink
the weight in kilograms of sugar in a randomly selected bag with capacity of 1kg

Probability density functions
The probability density function (pdf) of a continuous random variable X defined over a set S is a function f(x) such that the probability that X lies in the interval [a,b]
P(a <= X <= b) = ∫^b_a f(x) dx
the probability that X lies between a and b can be interpreted as the area bounded between f(x) and the x-axis over the interval x ∈ [a,b]
For a function f(x) to be a valid probability density function over a set S it must satisfy the following
f(x) >= 0 for all x in S
∫_S f(x) dx = 1
let random variable X be the result of randomly selecting a real number between 0 and 6. In this case the pdf of X is given by
f(x) = {
	1/6, 0 <= x <= 6
	0,   otherwise
}
this pdf tells us that any number between 0 and 6 has an equal chance of being selected and no number outside this interval can be selected.
this is a valid pdf because its always nonnegative
∫_S f(x) dx = ∫^6_0 1/6 dx
= [1/6(x)]|_0-6
= [1/6 * 6] - [1/6 * 0]
= 1
to compute the probability that our randomly delected number is no greater than 3 we integrate the pdf over the interval [0,3]
P(0 <= X <= 3) = ∫^3_0 1/6 dx
= [1/6(x)]|_0-3
= [1/6 * 3] - [1/6 * 0]
= 1/2
results matches our intuition since every number has an equal chance of being selected, and [0,3] is half the length of [0,6]

Interpreting probability density functions
The probability density function of a continuous random variable X is somewhat analogous to the probability mass function of a discrete random variable in the sense that it describes that probability distribution of X
Probability density is not the same as probability, instead we can think of a pdf as a tool for computing probabilites for continuous random variables.

two counterinteruitive yet important points to be aware of when it comes to interpreting a pdf
the probability that a continuous random variable takes on any particular value is always equal to 0
continuing the previous example, the probability that our random variable takes on the value X = 5 is equal to
P(X = 5) = P(5 <= X <= 5) = ∫^5_5 1/6 dx = 0
for any value a and any continuous random variable X with probability density function f(x)
P(X = a) = P(a <= X <= a) = ∫^a_a dx = 0
the values of a probability density function may be greater than 1
let Y be the result of randomly selecting a real number between 0 and 1/2 then the pdf of Y is given by
f(y) = 2, y ∈ [0,1/2]
this pdf tells us that all numbers between 0 and 1/2 are equally likely. f(y) is nonnegative
∫^(1/2)_0 f(y) dy = ∫^(1/2)_2 dy = 1
f(y) is a valid probability function
Since the probability that a continuous random variable takes on a particular value is always equal to 0, it doesn't matter wheter or not we include the endpoints of a particular interval for any continuous random variable X
P(a <= X <= b) = P(a < X < b) = P(a < X <= b) = P(a <= X < b)
= ∫^b_a f(x) dx

example:
(a graph going from x = -1 to x = 1 looks like a smile and y is above the x-axis)
f(x) = {
	3/8 (x^2 + 1),  -1 < x <= 1
	0,              otherwise
}
which is true?
1. f(x) >= 0 for all x
2. ∫^1_-1 f(x) dx = 1
3. f(x) is a valid probility density function
for a function f(x) to be a valid probability density function on set S, it must satisify the following conditions
f(x) >= 0 for all x
∫_S f(x) dx = 1
statement 1 is true, f(x) is nonnegative for all x
statement 2 is true
∫^1_-1 f(x) dx = ∫^1_-1 3/8 (x^2 + 1) dx
= 3/8 ∫^1_-1 x^2 + 1 dx
= 3/8 [x^3/3 + x]|_-1-1
= 3/8 ([1^3/3 + 1] - [(-1)^3/3 + (-1)])
= 3/8 ([1/3] + 1] - [-1/3 - 1])
= 3/8 ([4/3 - (-4/3)])
= 3/8 * 8/3
= 1
statement 3 is true, since statements 1 and 2 are true f(x) is a valid probability density function

determining the value of an unknown constant given a pdf
solve for k given the following function is a probability density function
f(x) = {
	2x^3 + kx^2,  0 < x < 1
	0,            otherwise
}
for a function f(x) to be a valid probability density function on a set S it must satisfy the following conditions
f(x) >= 0 for all x ∈ S
∫_S f(x) dx = 1
for the given function the second condition states
∫^1_0 (2x^3 + kx^2) dx = 1
= [x^4/2 + kx^3/3]|_0-1
= [1/2 + k/3] - 0
= k/3 + 1/2
k/3 + 1/2 = 1  =>  k = 3/2

example:
solve for k given the following function is a probability density function
f(x) = {
	k/x^2,  3 <= x <= 9
	0,      otherwise
}
∫_S f(x) dx = 1
∫^9_3 k/x^2 dx = 1
= k [x^-2]|_3-9
= k [-1/x]|_3-9
= k (-1/9) - (-1/3)
= k (-1/9) - (-3/9)
= k 2/9
2k/9 = 1  =>  k = 9/2

example:
solve for k given the following function is a probability density function
f(x) = {
	x^2/4 + k,  0 < x < 2
	0,          otherwise
}
∫_S f(x) dx = 1
∫^2_0 [x^2/4 + k] dx
= [x^3/12 + kx]|_0-2
= [8/12 + 2k] - 0
= 2/3 + 2k
= 2/3 + 2k = 1  =>  k = 1/6
